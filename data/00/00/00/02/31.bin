宇宙魔方已经苏醒
The Tesseract has awakened.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,120
它在一个渺小的世界  人类的世界
It is on a little world, a human world.

11
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,800
人类想要使用它的力量
They would wield its power,

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,770
但只有我们的盟友了解它
but our ally knows its workings

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,770
人类是痴心妄想
as they never will.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,360
他已经做好准备
He is ready to lead

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,860
率领我们的齐塔瑞大军
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,540
他将成为地球的主宰
A world will be his.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,590
而你将统治整个宇宙
The universe, yours.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,680
至于人类  只能乖乖接受毁灭的命运
And the humans, what can they do but burn?

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,910
全体人员注意  撤离命令已确认
All personnel, the evacuation order has been confirmed.

情况有多糟
How bad is it?

22
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,980
问题就在这里  长官  我们不知道
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
塞尔维格博士4小时前检测到
Dr Selvig read an energy surge

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,260
宇宙魔方释放出了一股能量涌
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,230
太空总署没有允许塞尔维格进行测试
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

26
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,670
他没做测试  他当时根本不在
He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,760
能量是自然触发
Spontaneous event.

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,120
它就自行启动了吗
It just turned itself on?

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,400
现在达到什么能量等级了
Where are the energy levels now?

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,960
还在上升  塞尔维格关不掉它
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down,

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,950
我们只好下令撤离
we ordered evac.

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,020
全员撤离还要多久
How long to get everyone out?

33
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,870
园区应能在半小时内清空
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

34
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,810
再快点
Do better.

35
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,260
长官  撤离可能也没有用
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,800
那我们该让大家回去睡觉吗
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,070
如果我们无法控制宇宙魔方的能量
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

38
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,620
危害波及范围或许会超出我们的想象
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,510
我要你去确认转移
I need you to make sure

40
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,600
二阶的所有原型机
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,890
长官  现在真的还要顾及那个吗
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

42
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,700
只要地球末日还没来临
Until such time as the world ends,

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,190
我们就还要做好充足的准备
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,400
清空地下的所有技术设备
Clear out the tech below.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,890
把二阶的所有设备装车运走
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

46
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,000
是  长官
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,490
跟我来
With me.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,130
博士  什么情况
Talk to me, Doctor.

49
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,590
局长
Director.

50
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,150
现在我们有确认的情况吗
Is there anything we know for certain?

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,960
宇宙魔方乱动起来了
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

52
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,190
-你在说笑吗  -这一点也不好笑
- Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it's not funny at all.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,070
宇宙魔方不止被激活了  她还  自作主张
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

54
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,310
你试过切断电源了吧
I assume you pulled the plug.

55
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,240
她自身就是能量源
She's an energy source.

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,020
我们关上电源  她能重新启动
We turn off the power, she turns it back on.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,820
如果她的能量达到峰值
If she reaches peak level...

58
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,580
我们为此做了准备  博士
We prepared for this, Doctor.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,530
利用来自宇宙的能量
Harnessing energy from space.

60
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,010
我们还没有掌控的能力
But we don't have the harness.

61
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,830
我的计算还远没有完成
My calculations are far from complete.

62
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,370
而现在她在释放干扰和辐射
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

63
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,810
没什么危害  只是低水平的伽马射线
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,770
那是能有危害的
That can be harmful.

65
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,620
巴顿特工呢
Where's Agent Barton?

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,360
那只鹰吗
The Hawk?

67
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,340
当然还是窝在巢里了
Up in his nest, as usual.

68
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,690
巴顿特工  回话
Agent Barton, report.

69
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,700
我让你负责安保
I gave you this detail

70
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,460
是让你密切关注一切情况
so you could keep a close eye on things.

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,380
我在高处看得更清楚
Well, I see better from a distance.

72
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,750
那你看到是什么激活了魔方吗
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

73
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,670
博士  能量又激增了
Doctor, it's spiking again.

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,480
没有人进出
No one's come or gone.

75
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,140
塞尔维格没问题
And Selvig's clean.

76
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,280
没与人接触或传递信息
No contacts, no IMs.

77
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,330
如果有谁在搞鬼  长官
If there was any tampering, sir,

78
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,750
也不是我们这边的人
it wasn't at this end.

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,520
什么意思
"At this end"?

80
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,130
魔方是通向宇宙另一端的门吧
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

81
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,820
而门从两边都能开
Doors open from both sides.

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,580
还没到
Not yet.

83
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,960
先生  请放下你的矛
Sir, please put down the spear.

84
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,390
你挺勇敢[有心]
You have heart.

85
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,890
劝你不要
Please don't.

86
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,520
我还需要它
I still need that.

87
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,220
没必要把事情闹得更大
This doesn't have to get any messier.

88
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,420
当然有必要
Of course it does.

89
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,830
我远道而来就是为了它
I've come too far for anything else.

90
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,990
我是洛基  来自阿斯加德
I am Loki, of Asgard

91
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,560
我肩负着光荣的使命
and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,630
洛基
Loki,

93
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,020
托尔的弟弟
brother of Thor.

94
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,630
我们跟你们毫无纠葛
We have no quarrel with your people.

95
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,710
就像蚂蚁也没有招惹靴子
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,220
你的意思是要踩死我们吗
Are you planning to step on us?

97
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,810
我带来了福音
I come with glad tidings

98
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,730
我要帮你们摆脱束缚
of a world made free.

99
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,040
什么的束缚
Free from what?

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,220
自由
Freedom.

101
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,680
自由是人生最大的谎言
Freedom is life's great lie.

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,310
如果你能发自内心接受这一点
Once you accept that, in your heart,

103
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,400
那你就能获得安宁
you will know peace.

104
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,660
你口口声声说安宁
Yeah, you say "Peace,"

105
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,480
但我觉得你的意思正相反
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

106
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,650
长官  弗瑞局长在拖延时间
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

107
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,940
这个地方就要爆炸了
This place is about to blow

108
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,960
我们会被压在几十米的石头下
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

109
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,970
他想要埋葬我们
He means to bury us.

110
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,500
就像古时的法老
Like the pharaohs of old.

111
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,740
他说得对  传送门正在自我塌陷
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

112
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,470
再过两分钟就会达到极值
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

113
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,530
那好吧
Well, then.

114
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,450
我要用这些车
I need these vehicles.

115
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,450
-那是谁  -不知道
- Who's that? - They didn't tell me.

116
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,350
希尔
Hill!

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,500
听得到吗
Do you copy?

118
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,140
巴顿叛变了
Barton has turned.

119
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,000
他们抢走了宇宙魔方  拦住他们
They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,420
好了  走吧  别管了  快走
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

121
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,680
楼上撤空了  长官  你得赶快离开
We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go.

122
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,570
局长
Director?

123
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,980
弗瑞局长  听到了吗
Director Fury, do you copy?

124
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,450
宇宙魔方被敌人抢走了
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

125
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,750
有人负伤  希尔你呢
I have men down. Hill?

126
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,870
还有很多人被埋在地下
A lot of men still under.

127
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,300
我不知道有多少幸存者
I don't know how many survivors.

128
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,540
发出全面命令
Sound a general call.

129
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,350
所有不参与救援的人员
I want every living soul not working rescue

130
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,840
去追查箱子的下落
looking for that briefcase.

131
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,780
明白
Roger that.

132
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,150
科尔森  返回基地  这是7级事件
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

133
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,760
现在
As of right now,

134
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,730
战争已经打响
we are at war.

135
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,240
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

136
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:49,480
{\an5}复仇者联盟

137
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,780
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}今晚和我想的不太一样

138
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,000
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我知道你是怎么想的

139
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,260
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}相信我

140
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,580
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}这样更好

141
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,480
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你为谁卖命

142
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,390
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}是勒曼托夫吗

143
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,950
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}他觉得

144
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,190
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我们还需要经过他同意

145
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,960
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}才能运我们的货吗

146
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,830
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}不是索罗霍布将军负责出口生意吗

147
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,290
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}索罗霍布

148
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,510
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}他就是个中间人  幌子

149
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,920
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你那过时的情报害了你

150
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,410
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}赫赫有名的黑寡妇

151
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,520
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}也不过是个花瓶而已

152
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,920
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你真的觉得我漂亮吗

153
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:13,010
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}告诉勒曼托夫  不劳他运坦克了

154
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,380
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}告诉他  他玩完了

155
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,190
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}不过

156
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
你可能得写下来了
...you may have to write it down.

157
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,230
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}找她的

158
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,960
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你给我听好了

159
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,130
你在114号索伦斯基广场三楼
You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

160
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,770
我们的F22战斗机距你只有8英里
We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

161
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,130
让那女人接电话  否则不等你跑到大厅
Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block

162
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,980
我就能炸平整条街
before you can make the lobby.

163
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,410
-你得回来  -你开玩笑吗  我在工作
- We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I'm working.

164
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,760
这事更紧急
This takes precedence.

165
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,280
我正在进行审讯
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

166
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,660
而这个傻逼什么都说了
This moron is giving me everything.

167
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,700
我没什么都说啊
I don't give everything.

168
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,560
听着  我现在脱不开身
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

169
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,550
娜塔莎
Natasha...

170
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,530
巴顿被策反了
Barton's been compromised.

171
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,090
你先别挂
Let me put you on hold.

172
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,490
巴顿现在在哪里
Where is Barton now?

173
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,100
-不知道  -他还活着吧
- We don't know. - But he's alive?

174
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,080
应该是的  等你回来再细说
We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.

175
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,330
但你得先去找大家伙谈谈
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

176
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,310
科尔森  你也知道斯塔克
Coulson, you know that Stark

177
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,680
并不怎么信任我
trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

178
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,190
斯塔克交给我  你去找那个"大家伙"
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

179
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,980
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}你是谁

180
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,280
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}快出去

181
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,080
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}这里有病人

182
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,840
你是医生
You're a doctor.

183
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,030
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我爸爸昏迷不醒

184
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,160
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}他发烧了  还一直难受地呻吟

185
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,460
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}但眼睛却睁不开

186
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,570
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}慢慢说

187
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,240
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}我爸爸

188
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,580
{\an2}{\pos(192,238)}像他们一样吗

189
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,660
求你了
Please.

190
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,430
该先收钱的  班纳
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

191
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,220
对于一个该远离压力的人来说
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress

192
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,730
你可真是选了一个好地方安居
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

193
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,590
远离压力不是我的诀窍
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

194
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,860
那是什么  做瑜伽吗
Then what is it? Yoga?

195
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,990
你把我引到郊区来  真聪明
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

196
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,390
这里肯定被包围了吧
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

197
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,980
只有你和我
Just you and me.

198
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,190
你那个小演员呢
And your actress buddy?

199
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,790
她也是间谍吗  入行还真早啊
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

200
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,940
我当年就是
I did.

201
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,580
你是谁
Who are you?

202
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,100
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Natasha Romanoff.

203
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,690
你是来杀我的吗  罗曼诺夫女士
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

204
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,130
因为那对所有人都不会有好结果的
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

205
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,300
不  当然不是  我是代表神盾局而来
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

206
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,010
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

207
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,280
他们怎么找到我的
How did they find me?

208
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,590
我们一直掌握着你的行踪  博士
We never lost you, Doctor.

209
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,190
只是一直保持着距离
We've kept our distance.

210
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,300
甚至还替你甩掉了一些其他相关方
Even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.

211
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,020
为什么
Why?

212
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,960
尼克·弗瑞还挺信任你
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

213
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,990
但现在你得跟我走
But now we need you to come in.

214
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,650
要是我不肯呢
What if I say no?

215
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,780
我会说服你
I'll persuade you.

216
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,260
要是...那个家伙不肯呢
And what if the other guy says no?

217
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,160
你一年多没出过"事故"了
You've been more than a year without an incident.

218
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,360
我想你应该也不想破这个戒
I don't think you want to break that streak.

219
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,450
我并不是总能如愿的
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

220
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,580
博士  我们可能要迎来一场全球灾难
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

221
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,280
那是我一直在努力避免的
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

222
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,350
这个
This

223
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,160
是宇宙魔方
is the Tesseract.

224
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,580
它有毁灭整个地球的能量
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

225
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,140
那弗瑞想要我做什么  把它吃掉吗
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

226
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,950
他要你找到它  它被抢走了
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

227
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,290
它发出的伽马信号太弱  我们无法追踪
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

228
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,860
而你是最了解伽马射线的人了
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

229
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,650
否则我也不会来找你
If there was, that's where I'd be.

230
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,670
所以  弗瑞不是派你来抓怪物的咯
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

231
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,190
反正他不是这么跟我说的
Not that he's told me.

232
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,840
他什么都会跟你说吗
And he tells you everything?

233
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,670
去跟弗瑞谈吧  他需要你的帮助
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

234
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,690
他要把我关起来吗
He needs me in a cage?

235
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,800
没有人会把你关起...
No one's going to put you in a...

236
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,320
不要再骗我了
Stop lying to me!

237
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,960
抱歉  我不该这么凶
I'm sorry. That was mean.

238
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,510
我就是想试探一下你
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

239
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,140
这样吧  我们好好说话
Why don't we do this the easy way

240
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,680
你把枪收起来
where you don't use that

241
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,740
而我也确保那个家伙不会乱来
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

242
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,340
好吗
Okay?

243
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,800
娜塔莎
Natasha?

244
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,630
退后
Stand down.

245
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,790
一切正常
We're good here.

246
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,300
还说"只有你和我"呢
"Just you and me."

247
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,130
这太过分了  局长
This is out of line, Director.

248
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,040
你在摆弄你控制不了的力量
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

249
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,040
你打过仗吗  理事先生  上过战场吗
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

250
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,090
你那时觉得能完全掌控局面吗
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

251
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,510
你是说这个阿斯加德已经向地球宣战了吗
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

252
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,400
不是阿斯加德  只是洛基
Not Asgard. Loki.

253
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,860
他不可能是单干  另一个神呢
He can't be working alone. What about the other one?

254
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,350
他哥哥
His brother.

255
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,670
根据我们的情报  托尔不是敌人
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

256
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,060
但他离我们太远了
but he's worlds away.

257
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,950
我们不能指望他来帮忙
We can't depend on him to help, either.

258
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,890
我们只能靠自己
It's up to us.

259
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,820
所以你更应该全力开发二阶
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

260
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,080
它正是为这种情况...
It was designed for exactly this...

261
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,740
二阶还没完成  但敌人却准备好了
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

262
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,470
我们需要一支应急小队
We need a response team.

263
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,930
复仇者计划已被取消
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

264
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,690
我不是指复仇者联盟
This isn't about the Avengers.

265
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,860
我们看过那份名单
We've seen the list.

266
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,450
你有着世界一流的秘密特工组织
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

267
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,310
却要把人类的命运交给
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

268
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,700
一群怪胎吗
to a handful of freaks.

269
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,880
我没有要把任何事交给任何人
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

270
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,380
我们确实需要一支应急小队
We need a response team.

271
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,300
这些人或许孤僻  甚至不太正常
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even

272
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,220
但我相信只要有正确的动力
but I believe with the right push

273
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,880
他们就能成为我们需要的力量
they can be exactly what we need.

274
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,380
你相信吗
You believe?

275
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,710
靠感情可赢不了战争  局长
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

276
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,910
是的  只能靠战士
No, it's won by soldiers.

277
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,700
没时间了
There's not enough time.

278
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,220
我得让飞机坠海
I got to put her in the water!

279
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,770
你不是一个人
You won't be alone.

280
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,140
天啊
Oh, my God.

281
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,620
这家伙还活着
This guy is still alive!

282
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,170
睡不着吗
Trouble sleeping?

283
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,030
我睡了70年  长官  我想我睡得够久了
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

284
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,700
那你该出去走走
Then you should be out,

285
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,500
庆祝一下  看看世界
celebrating, seeing the world.

286
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,700
我沉睡的时候  世界还在打仗
When I went under, the world was at war.

287
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,910
等我醒来  他们说战争打赢了
I wake up, they say we won.

288
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,360
却没说我们失去了什么
They didn't say what we lost.

289
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,080
我们一路走来犯了些错误
We've made some mistakes along the way.

290
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,580
有些就在不久之前
Some, very recently.

291
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,910
你有任务要给我吗  长官
Are you here with a mission, sir?

292
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,990
是的
I am.

293
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,790
想让我回归这个世界吗
Trying to get me back in the world?

294
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,750
是让你拯救世界
Trying to save it.

295
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,200
九头蛇的秘密武器
HYDRA's secret weapon.

296
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,560
{\an8}宇宙魔方

297
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,930
是霍华德·斯塔克在找你的时候
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean

298
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,800
从海底打捞上来的
when he was looking for you.

299
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,680
他和我们想的一样
He thought what we think.

300
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,300
宇宙魔方是开发无限可再生能源的关键
The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.

301
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,430
这正是世界所迫切需要的
That's something the world sorely needs.

302
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,950
它被谁抢走了
Who took it from you?

303
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,370
他叫洛基
He's called Loki.

304
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,130
他不是本地人
He's not from around here.

305
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,930
你加入的话还有很多情况需要了解
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.

306
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,390
这世界和你记忆中的比起来
The world has gotten even stranger

307
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,760
变得更加奇怪了
than you already know.

308
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,950
事到如今  我觉得已经没什么能让我意外了
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.

309
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,830
我赌10块钱  说你错了
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

310
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,790
任务资料
There's a debriefing packet

311
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,910
已经放在你公寓了
waiting for you back at your apartment.

312
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,370
关于宇宙魔方
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract

313
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,260
你能告诉我们什么吗
that we ought to know now?

314
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,940
你们就不该把它捞上来
You should have left it in the ocean.

315
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,290
这边准备就绪  接下来看你的了
Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.

316
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,790
你断开输电线了吗
You disconnected the transmission lines?

317
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,900
我们与电网断开了吗
Are we off the grid?

318
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,660
斯塔克大厦即将成为
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon

319
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,870
自给清洁能源的灯塔
of self-sustaining clean energy.

320
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,810
如果方舟反应堆能接替发电
Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over

321
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,440
并且正常运行的话
and it actually works.

322
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,550
应该没问题
I assume.

323
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,310
开灯吧
Light her up.

324
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,250
{\an8}斯塔克

325
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,010
看起来怎么样
How does it look?

326
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,940
像圣诞彩灯  但更有我的风格
Like Christmas, but with more me.

327
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,780
我们得加大公众宣传
We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.

328
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,570
你得在媒体上造势
You need to do some press.

329
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,380
我明天去华盛顿
I'm in DC tomorrow,

330
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,190
为另外三座大楼选址
I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.

331
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,800
派珀  你把气氛都毁了  当下
Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?

332
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,050
要享受当下
Enjoy the moment.

333
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,750
等你进来我再享受
Get in here and I will.

334
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,020
先生  神盾局的科尔森特工打来电话
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

335
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,970
说我在外面
I'm not in.

336
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,030
我确实在外面
I'm actually out.

337
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,540
先生  恐怕他坚持要找您
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

338
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,750
强硬点  贾维斯  我有约会
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

339
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,500
能量水平稳定...吧
Levels are holding steady, I think.

340
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,920
当然了  是我亲自动手的
Of course they are. I was directly involved.

341
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,110
这正好让我想到一个问题
Which brings me to my next question.

342
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,370
当天才的感觉如何
How does it feel to be a genius?

343
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,930
我怎么会知道
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

344
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,010
这叫什么话  这一切都归功于你
What do you mean? All this came from you.

345
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,790
不  这一切都归功于这个
No, all this came from that.

346
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,840
别这么谦虚  拜托
Give yourself some credit. Please.

347
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,850
斯塔克大厦就是你的孩子
Stark Tower is your baby.

348
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,820
你有12%的功劳
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

349
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,010
才12%
12%?

350
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,300
商量一下可以升到15%
An argument can be made for 15.

351
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,130
我的孩子我只有12%的份
12%? My baby?

352
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,730
毕竟重活都是我干的
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

353
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,010
都不是比喻  重物都是我搬的
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

354
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,500
而且  不好意思  安全漏洞怎么算
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

355
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,100
该算在你头上
That was on you.

356
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,810
-我的私人电梯  -你是说我们的电梯吧
- My private elevator... - You mean our elevator?

357
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,610
挤满了一身臭汗的工人
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

358
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,660
过会儿你会因为我说了占多少份这话
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages

359
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,700
而温柔地报复我  是吧
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

360
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,610
没你想的那么温柔
It's not going to be that subtle.

361
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,700
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

362
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,570
我在下一栋大楼上写上你的名字
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.

363
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,170
直接写在地契上吧
On the lease.

364
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,630
打电话问问你妈  你能留下过夜吗
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

365
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,800
先生  您的电话
Sir, the telephone.

366
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,140
恐怕我的程序被人改写了
I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.

367
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,890
斯塔克  我们得谈谈
Mr Stark, we need to talk.

368
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,340
这里是托尼·斯塔克的生化机器人替身
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.

369
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,360
-有事请留言  -是急事
- Please leave a message. - This is urgent.

370
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,710
那就说得急一点
Then leave it urgently.

371
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,180
安全漏洞  你的错
Security breach. It's on you.

372
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,940
-斯塔克先生  -菲尔  快进来
- Mr Stark. - Phil! Come in.

373
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,880
菲尔
"Phil"?

374
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,990
我不能久留
I can't stay.

375
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,800
他的名字不是"特工"吗
His first name is "Agent."

376
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,310
进来吧  我们在庆祝
Come on in. We're celebrating.

377
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,050
所以他不能久留
Which is why he can't stay.

378
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,740
你得尽快看完这些资料
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

379
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,820
我不喜欢别人递我东西
I don't like being handed things.

380
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,510
没事  我就喜欢别人递我东西
That's fine, because I love to be handed things.

381
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,120
我们换换吧
So, let's trade.

382
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,620
谢谢
Thank you.

383
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,300
我的正式咨询时间为每隔一周的周四8点到5点
Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.

384
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,440
这不是咨询
This isn't a consultation.

385
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,240
是关于复仇者联盟吗
Is this about the Avengers?

386
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,410
我对那个一无所知
Which I know nothing about.

387
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,130
复仇者计划不是被弃了吗
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

388
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,960
再说我都不够格
And I didn't even qualify.

389
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,810
这我也不知情
I didn't know that either.

390
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,200
显然人家嫌我不稳定  自我为中心
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

391
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,590
没有团队精神
don't play well with others.

392
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,420
这我倒是知道
That I did know.

393
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,410
我们现在顾不上性格问题了
This isn't about personality profiles any more.

394
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,990
随便了  波茨小姐  能过来一下吗
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

395
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,180
稍等
Half a mo.

396
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,860
我以为我们能浪漫一会呢
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

397
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,010
我只能享受12%的浪漫
I was having 12% of a moment.

398
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,320
情况好像很严重  菲尔看上去挺紧张
This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.

399
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,410
你怎么知道  你干嘛叫他菲尔
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

400
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,430
这都是什么
What is all this?

401
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,490
这是
This is

402
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,530
自己看吧
this.

403
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,020
我今晚就飞去华盛顿
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

404
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,210
-明天吧  -你有功课要做  很多功课
- Tomorrow. - You have homework. You have a lot of homework.

405
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,020
要是我没有呢
Well, what if I didn't?

406
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,160
-没有  -是啊
- If you didn't? - Yeah.

407
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,930
你是说等你做完了吗
You mean when you've finished?

408
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,600
那样的话
Well, then...

409
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,540
说定了  旅途顺利
Square deal. Fly safe.

410
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,490
好好用功
Work hard.

411
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,220
你会路过拉瓜地亚机场吗
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?

412
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,840
-我捎你一程吧  -太好了
- I can drop you. - Fantastic.

413
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,110
那个大提琴手怎么样了
I want to hear about the cellist.

414
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,190
你们还在约会吗
Is that still a thing?

415
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,460
她回波特兰了
She moved back to Portland.

416
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,540
怎么会
What?

417
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,950
我们离总部还有约40分钟航程  长官
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

418
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,730
班纳博士企图复制我所注射的血清吗
So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

419
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,980
很多人都试过
A lot of people were.

420
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,270
你是世上第一个超级英雄
You were the world's first superhero.

421
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,620
班纳以为伽马射线可能是破解
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key

422
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,070
厄斯金原始配方的关键
to unlocking Erskine's original formula.

423
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,820
可惜结果不怎么好  是吧
Didn't really go his way, did it?

424
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,870
是啊
Not so much.

425
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,430
不过他正常的时候
When he's not that thing, though,

426
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,520
他简直就像史蒂芬·霍金
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

427
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,820
他是个聪明绝顶的人
He's like a smart person.

428
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,970
我必须要说
I gotta say,

429
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,240
我很荣幸能正式见到你
it's an honour to meet you officially.

430
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,390
我之前其实算是见过你
I've sort of met you. I mean,

431
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,370
你沉睡时我去看过你
I watched you while you were sleeping.

432
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,680
我是说  我们发现
I mean, I was present

433
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,970
被冰冻昏迷不醒的你时  我也在场
while you were unconscious from the ice.

434
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,030
说真的  你能加入我们
You know, it's really just a huge honour

435
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,020
真是莫大的荣幸
to have you on board this...

436
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,760
希望我能胜任
I hope I'm the man for the job.

437
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,070
你肯定能  毫无疑问
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

438
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,420
我们对你的制服做了些修改
We made some modifications to the uniform.

439
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,750
我还提了点设计意见
I had a little design input.

440
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,050
我的制服
The uniform?

441
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,810
星条的样式不会...
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

442
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,890
太过时了吗
old-fashioned?

443
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,300
考虑到眼下的局势
With everything that's happening

444
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,190
和即将到来的恶战
and the things that are about to come to light,

445
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,930
人们或许正需要点过去的精神
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

446
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,920
齐塔瑞人越来越耐不住了
The Chitauri grow restless.

447
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,840
叫他们控制好自己
Let them gird themselves.

448
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,870
我会率领他们发动一场光辉的战役
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

449
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,950
战役
Battle?

450
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,160
捏死地球上的虫子也叫战役吗
Against the meagre might of Earth?

451
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,500
光辉而轻松的战役
Glorious, not lengthy.

452
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,240
前提是你的大军真如你说的那样所向披靡
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

453
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
你竟敢质疑我们
You question us?

454
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,550
质疑他
You question him,

455
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,710
别忘了是他把权杖交给了你
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

456
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,890
传授你远古的真知  给予你新的使命
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

457
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,080
在你被流放和挫败的时候
when you were cast out, defeated?

458
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,330
我曾是王
I was a king!

459
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,910
阿斯加德的合法国王
The rightful king of Asgard,

460
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,960
却被背叛
betrayed.

461
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,150
你的志向  渺小
Your ambition is little

462
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,820
而幼稚
and born of childish need.

463
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,550
我们要的不止是地球
We look beyond the Earth

464
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,950
宇宙魔方会开启更广博的世界
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

465
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,130
宇宙魔方还在我这里呢
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

466
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,430
我没有威胁你的意思
I don't threaten.

467
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,790
但只要传送门尚未打开
But until I open the doors,

468
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,660
你的军队还非由我统领
until your force is mine to command,

469
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,780
你也只是空谈
you are but words.

470
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,510
你去发动战争吧  阿斯加德人
You will have your war, Asgardian.

471
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,780
可如果你失败了
If you fail,

472
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,680
如果宇宙魔方落入他人之手
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

473
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,610
无论你躲到什么地方
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

474
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,820
我们也会把你找出来
no crevice where he cannot find you.

475
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,090
你自以为了解痛苦的滋味吗
You think you know pain?

476
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,670
他能让你
He will make you long

477
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,790
渴求痛苦的甜蜜
for something sweet as pain.

478
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,070
-去拿队长的装备  -是  长官
- Stow the captain's gear. - Yes, sir.

479
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,570
罗曼诺夫特工  这位是罗杰斯队长
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

480
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,550
女士
Ma'am.

481
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,830
舰桥那边找你
They need you on the bridge.

482
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,830
他们开始面部识别追踪了
They're starting the face-trace.

483
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,810
待会儿见
See you there.

484
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,240
在冰层中找到你的事引起了不小的轰动
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

485
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,050
我还以为科尔森会开心得晕过去
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

486
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,980
他求你给他的美国队长收藏卡签名了吗
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

487
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,130
收藏卡
Trading cards?

488
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,690
绝版珍藏  他很引以为傲
They're vintage. He's very proud.

489
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,320
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

490
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,690
你好
Yeah, hi.

491
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,860
我听说你要来
They told me you would be coming.

492
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,470
我听说你能找到魔方
Word is, you can find the Cube.

493
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,350
你没听说别的事吗
Is that the only word on me?

494
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,890
我只在意这个
Only word I care about.

495
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,850
你一定觉得这一切很奇怪吧
It must be strange for you, all of this.

496
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,260
老实说  我还觉得挺熟悉的
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

497
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,180
先生们  你们还是快进去吧
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

498
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,490
这里过会儿就难以呼吸了
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

499
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,930
空勤人员  清空甲板
Flight crew, secure the deck.

500
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,560
这是潜艇吗
Is this a submarine?

501
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,580
是吗
Really?

502
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,820
他们要我待在水下密闭加压的金属罐里吗
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

503
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,560
不  这个更糟
No, no, this is much worse.

504
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,690
盘旋动力检查完毕  位置稳定
Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.

505
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,450
动力增大至8%
Increase collective to 8.0%.

506
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,630
准备全速起航
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

507
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,310
将输出升到最高
Increase output to capacity.

508
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,770
全速模式
Power plant performing at capacity.

509
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,350
准备就绪
We are clear.

510
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,050
引擎全部开启
All engines operating.

511
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,390
执行神盾局193.6号紧急协议
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

512
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,100
-已达预定高度  长官  -很好
- We are at level, sir. - Good.

513
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,210
我们消失吧
Let's vanish.

514
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,420
开启反光板
Engage retro-reflection panels.

515
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,050
反光板已开启
Reflection panels engaged.

516
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,080
先生们
Gentlemen.

517
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,220
博士  谢谢你能来
Doctor, thank you for coming.

518
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,880
谢谢你们礼貌地邀请我
Thanks for asking nicely.

519
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,780
我要在这里待上多久
So, how long am I staying?

520
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,810
我们一拿到宇宙魔方
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

521
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,970
就会让你走
you're in the wind.

522
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,340
你们进展如何
Where are you with that?

523
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,830
我们扫描了全球所有
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

524
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,500
可无线读取的摄像头
camera on the planet.

525
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,870
手机  笔记本
Cell phones, laptops...

526
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,220
只要连接了卫星  就是我们的眼线
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

527
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,680
就这么找还是来不及
That's still not gonna find them in time.

528
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,000
你们得缩小范围
You have to narrow your field.

529
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
你能调用多少台光谱仪
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

530
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,880
要多少有多少
How many are there?

531
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,120
联系所有你能找到的实验室
Call every lab you know.

532
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,700
让他们把光谱仪放在房顶
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

533
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,640
校准搜索伽马射线
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

534
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,070
我会根据聚类识别草拟出追踪算法
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

535
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,460
至少能排除几个区域
At least we could rule out a few places.

536
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,850
能给我找个工作的地方吗
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

537
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,930
罗曼诺夫特工
Agent Romanoff,

538
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,270
你能带班纳博士去他的实验室吗
could you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please?

539
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,980
你准满意  博士  那里一应俱全
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

540
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,620
放去那边
Put it over there.

541
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,340
你从哪里找来的这些人
Where did you find all these people?

542
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,070
神盾局的敌人到处都是  博士
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

543
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,060
{\an8}铱  海因里希·赛弗博士

544
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,320
你要的是这个吗
Is this the stuff you need?

545
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,260
对  铱
Yeah, iridium.

546
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,230
陨石里的物质  能形成反质子
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

547
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,090
这东西很难找
It's very hard to get hold of.

548
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,870
要是神盾局知道你需要它就更难找了
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

549
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,070
我可不知道
Well, I didn't know.

550
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,580
宇宙魔方让我看到了太多
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

551
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,800
这些超越了知识  而是真理
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

552
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,740
我知道
I know.

553
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,190
它让你看到了什么  巴顿特工
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

554
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,810
我的下个目标
My next target.

555
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,210
告诉我你需要什么
Tell me what you need.

556
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,750
一场声东击西
I need a distraction.

557
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,140
和一个眼球
And an eyeball.

558
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,970
那个...太麻烦就算了
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

559
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,460
哪里  不麻烦
No, no. It's fine.

560
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,430
那是绝版套装
It's a vintage set.

561
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,100
我花了几年才集齐
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

562
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,130
还很新呢
Near mint.

563
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,700
边角有点泛黄  但...
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

564
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,530
有发现  面部特征67%匹配
We got a hit. A 67% match.

565
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,080
等等  交叉比对显示79%匹配
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

566
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,550
在哪
Location?

567
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,900
德国斯图加特  库宁大街28号
Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.

568
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,210
他没有躲起来的意思
He's not exactly hiding.

569
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,290
队长
Captain,

570
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,030
该你上场了
you're up.

571
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,950
{\an5}{\pos(138.4,63.466)}视网膜扫描-身份识别

572
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,950
{\an5}{\pos(173.6,120)}认证

{\an5}{\pos(175,149)}海因里希·赛弗博士

{\an5}{\pos(175,179)}开锁

575
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,760
给我跪下
Kneel before me.

576
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,180
我说了
I said

577
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,390
跪下
kneel!

578
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,620
这样不是更简单吗
Is not this simpler?

579
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,500
这难道不是你们的本性吗
Is this not your natural state?

580
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,920
这是人类心照不宣的本性
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

581
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,970
你们渴望被征服
that you crave subjugation.

582
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,620
自由的光鲜诱惑
The bright lure of freedom

583
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,570
削减了你们人生的乐趣  让你们发狂地追逐权力
diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,

584
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,430
追逐个性
for identity.

585
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,550
你们天生就该被统治
You were made to be ruled.

586
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,040
到头来
In the end,

587
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,450
你们总会俯首称臣
you will always kneel.

588
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,300
不会向你这样的人
Not to men like you.

589
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,370
从没有像我这样的人
There are no men like me.

590
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,080
总是有像你这样的人
There are always men like you.

591
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,120
瞧瞧这个老头  各位
Look to your elder, people.

592
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,350
我就用他  杀一儆百
Let him be an example.

593
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,150
我上次来德国的时候
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

594
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,390
也遇到一个自以为高高在上的人
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

595
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,630
我们也有点意见不合
we ended up disagreeing.

596
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,100
美国大兵
The soldier.

597
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,110
过时的人
The man out of time.

598
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,140
快要玩完的人可不是我
I'm not the one who's out of time.

599
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,250
洛基  放下武器  马上投降
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

600
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,070
跪下
Kneel.

601
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,950
休想
Not today!

602
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,880
到处都是他的分身
The guy's all over the place.

603
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,600
罗曼诺夫特工  想我了吗
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

604
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,840
{\an8}广播系统被改写

605
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,220
出招啊  小鹿斑比
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

606
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,160
这才乖
Good move.

607
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,290
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

608
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,130
队长
Captain.

609
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,850
他开口了吗
Is he saying anything?

610
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,510
什么都没说
Not a word.

611
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,280
带回来再说  我们没时间了
Just get him here. We're low on time.

612
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,320
我有不好的预感
I don't like it.

613
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,210
怎么  因为摇滚明星就这么轻易投降了吗
What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

614
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,340
我可不觉得有多轻易
I don't remember it being that easy.

615
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,990
这家伙战斗力很强
This guy packs a wallop.

616
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,100
不管怎样  你一把年纪  身手还算敏捷
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

617
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,460
你做什么锻炼  普拉提吗
What's your thing, Pilates?

618
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,350
什么
What?

619
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,520
就跟健美操差不多
It's like calisthenics.

620
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,920
你或许是错过了不少事
You might have missed a couple of things

621
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,670
毕竟做了那么久的美队冰棒
doing time as a Capsicle.

622
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,220
弗瑞没告诉我他也找你了
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

623
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,630
是啊  弗瑞还有很多事没告诉你
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

624
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,840
哪来的闪电
Where's this coming from?

625
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,670
怎么了  你连闪电都怕吗
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

626
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,710
我是不喜欢跟随闪电而来的家伙
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

627
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,250
你要干什么
What are you doing?

628
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,820
又来个添乱的
And now there's that guy.

629
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,390
他也是阿斯加德人吗
Another Asgardian?

630
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,780
-你觉得他是友军吗  -无所谓
- That guy's a friendly? - Doesn't matter.

631
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,360
不管他要放了洛基还是杀了他
If he frees Loki or kills him,

632
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,770
宇宙魔方都找不回来了
the Tesseract's lost.

633
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,910
斯塔克  我们需要出击计划
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

634
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,280
我有个计划  出击
I have a plan. Attack.

635
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,860
我劝你别搅这浑水  队长
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

636
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,260
这我做不到
I don't see how I can.

637
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,460
他们是传说人物  基本上就是神
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

638
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,040
神只有上帝一个  女士
There's only one God, ma'am.

639
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,100
而且他肯定不会穿成那样
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

640
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,270
宇宙魔方在哪
Where is the Tesseract?

641
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:59,890
我也想你  哥哥
I missed you, too.

642
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,090
我像是有心情陪你胡闹吗
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

643
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,690
你应该谢谢我
You should thank me.

644
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,300
没有了彩虹桥
With the Bifrost gone,

645
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,740
奥丁是聚集了多少黑暗能量
how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster

646
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,250
才把你传送过来
to conjure you here

647
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,000
到你心爱的地球
to your precious Earth?

648
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,160
我以为你死了
I thought you dead.

649
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,610
你为我哀悼了吗
Did you mourn?

650
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,720
我们都哀悼了  我们的父王
We all did. Our father...

651
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,340
是你的父王
Your father.

652
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,970
他把我的身世告诉你了吧
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

653
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,800
我们从小一起长大
We were raised together.

654
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,950
一起玩耍  一起战斗
We played together, we fought together.

655
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,900
你都不记得了吗
Do you remember none of that?

656
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,380
我只记得阴影
I remember a shadow.

657
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,990
我一直笼罩在你伟大的阴影之下
Living in the shade of your greatness.

658
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,000
我只记得你将我推下深渊
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

659
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,990
我本来是王  也本该是王
I, who was, and should be, king!

660
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,170
所以你自认为受了轻视  为了报复我
So you take the world I love as a recompense

661
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,350
就破坏我所爱的世界吗
for your imagined slights?

662
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,650
休想  我会保护地球  洛基
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

663
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,760
那你可保护得真好
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

664
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,790
人类彼此之间互相残杀
The humans slaughter each other in droves

665
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,870
你却袖手旁观
while you idly fret.

666
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,020
我想要统治他们  这有什么不对
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

667
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,090
你自以为高他们一等吗
You think yourself above them?

668
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:13,930
当然
Well, yes.

669
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,640
那你就误解了统治的真谛  弟弟
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

670
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,230
你不适合做王
A throne would suit you ill.

671
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,460
我见识到了你根本不知道的世界
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

672
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,040
在流放期间  奥丁森  我开了眼界
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

673
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,910
我见识到了宇宙魔方的真正力量
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

674
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,960
等我用它...
and when I wield it...

675
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,560
是谁向你展示了它的力量
Who showed you this power?

676
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,210
你这自封之王听命于谁
Who controls the would-be king?

677
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,420
-我就是王  -在这里不是
- I am a king! - Not here!

678
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,540
你交出宇宙魔方
You give up the Tesseract!

679
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,760
放弃这恶毒的野心
You give up this poisonous dream!

680
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,320
你跟我回家
You come home.

681
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,670
魔方不在我手上
I don't have it.

682
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,540
没有魔方你就不能带我回家
You need the Cube to bring me home.

683
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,850
但我把它转移了  我也不知道它在哪里
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

684
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,640
你给我听好  弟弟
You listen well, brother.

685
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,790
我听着呢
I'm listening.

686
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,960
再动我就要你好看
Do not touch me again.

687
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,800
那你也别动我的东西
Then don't take my stuff.

688
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,450
你根本不知道自己面对的是什么
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

689
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,210
莎翁戏剧的公园公演吗
Shakespeare in the Park?

690
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:30,680
尔取帘为披风  汝母可知
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

691
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,650
这超出了你的能力范围  铁皮人
This is beyond you, metal man.

692
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,970
洛基会受到阿斯加德的制裁
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

693
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:39,010
只要他交出魔方  他就随你处置  否则
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

694
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,760
你少碍事
stay out of the way.

695
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,540
外地人
Tourist.

696
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,480
好吧
Okay.

697
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,560
能量达到400%
Power at 400% capacity.

698
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,670
这倒是不赖
How about that?

699
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,130
够了
That's enough.

700
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,770
我不知道你想做什么
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

701
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,300
我是来终结洛基的阴谋
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

702
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,250
那就拿出行动来  把锤子放下
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

703
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,210
哦不
Yeah... No.

704
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,250
坏主意  他爱死那锤子了
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

705
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,570
你要我放下锤子吗
You want me to put the hammer down?

706
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,370
闹够了吗
Are we done, here?

707
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,840
我先把话说清楚
In case it's unclear,

708
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,920
你要是试图逃跑
if you try to escape,

709
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,810
你就算是刮了一下玻璃
if you so much as scratch that glass,

710
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,700
这个牢笼就会从三万英尺的高空坠落
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

711
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,310
你明白了吗
You get how that works?

712
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:34,470
现在谁是蚂蚁  谁是靴子
Ant, boot.

713
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,750
这个笼子真不赖
It's an impressive cage.

714
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,680
我猜不是为我造的吧
Not built, I think, for me.

715
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,960
是为比你厉害得多的东西建的
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

716
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,470
我听说了
Oh, I've heard.

717
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,510
一头毫无心智的野兽
A mindless beast.

718
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,060
却装作自己仍是常人
Makes play he's still a man.

719
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,400
你是有多绝望
How desperate are you,

720
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,670
找来这种无法控制的怪物保护你们
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

721
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,510
我有多绝望
How desperate am I?

722
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,030
你威胁要向我的世界开战
You threaten my world with war.

723
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,470
你偷走了自己无法掌控的力量
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

724
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,010
你说着和平  却以杀戮为乐
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

725
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,770
你确实逼得我很绝望
You have made me very desperate.

726
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,890
你或许会因此而后悔
You might not be glad that you did.

727
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,920
失去快到手的东西让你很生气吧
It burns you to have come so close.

728
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,650
得到宇宙魔方  掌握它的力量
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

729
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,010
无限的能量
unlimited power.

730
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,830
用来做什么
And for what?

731
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,720
为全人类点亮一盏明灯
A warm light for all mankind to share.

732
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,410
之后却又见识到了真正的力量
And then to be reminded what real power is.

733
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:48,690
"真正力量"要是想看杂志了就吱一声
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

734
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,860
他还真是惹人喜欢
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

735
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,900
洛基是在拖延时间
Loki's gonna drag this out.

736
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,670
托尔  他到底有什么打算
So, Thor, what's his play?

737
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,510
他有一支齐塔瑞大军
He has an army called the Chitauri.

738
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,810
他们不是阿斯加德人  而是来自未知世界
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

739
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,130
他打算率领这支大军攻打你们
He means to lead them against your people.

740
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,900
他们会帮助他夺取地球
They will win him the Earth,

741
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,710
我猜他会用宇宙魔方作为交换
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

742
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,820
大军
An army

743
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,520
还是来自外太空
from outer space.

744
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,460
那他还要建个传送门
So, he's building another portal.

745
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,000
这就是他带走艾瑞克·塞尔维格的目的
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

746
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,990
塞尔维格
Selvig?

747
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,370
-他是个天体物理学家  -他是我朋友
- He's an astrophysicist. - He's a friend.

748
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,740
洛基对他施了法术  控制了他
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

749
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,340
还有我们的一个特工
along with one of ours.

750
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,500
洛基为什么会这么轻易投降
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

751
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,610
他在这里可没法指挥大军
He's not leading an army from here.

752
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,540
我觉得我们不该一直关注洛基
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

753
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,580
那家伙的脑回路不正常
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

754
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,880
一看就是个疯子
You could smell crazy on him.

755
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,320
注意你的言辞
Have care how you speak.

756
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,910
即使洛基失去了理智  他还是阿斯加德人
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

757
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,230
还是我弟弟
And he is my brother.

758
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,880
他两天内杀了80个人
He killed 80 people in two days.

759
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,270
他是领养的
He's adopted.

760
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,690
我觉得我们该着重技术问题
I think it's about the mechanics.

761
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,590
铱  他们为什么需要铱
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

762
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,980
铱可用作稳定剂
It's a stabilising agent.

763
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,210
我就说  挑个周末
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

764
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,950
我飞你去波特兰
I'll fly you to Portland.

765
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,410
爱情要维护的啊
Keep love alive.

766
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,710
它能防止传送门自我塌陷
It means the portal won't collapse on itself

767
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,110
像之前在神盾局基地那样
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

768
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,740
别记仇  惊爆点  你真挺有劲
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

769
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,870
还能让传送门按洛基的心意
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

770
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,400
想开多大  多久都没问题
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

771
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,790
升起后桅  调转顶帆
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

772
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,530
那个人在玩小蜜蜂
That man is playing Galaga.

773
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,190
自以为别人看不到  但我看到了
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

774
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,410
弗瑞怎么能看到两边的屏幕
How does Fury even see these?

775
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,390
转身看
He turns.

776
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,680
很累人的样子
Sounds exhausting.

777
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,500
其他原材料
The rest of the raw materials,

778
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,440
巴顿特工都能轻易弄到手
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

779
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,640
他只缺少一个要素  能源
The only major component he still needs is a power source

780
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,750
一种高密度能量
of high-energy density.

781
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,190
来激活魔方
Something to kick-start the Cube.

782
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,470
你什么时候对热核天体物理学这么精通了
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

783
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,930
就昨晚
Last night.

784
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,690
任务资料  塞尔维格的笔记
The packet, Selvig's notes,

785
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,360
萃取论论文
the extraction theory papers.

786
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,440
你们都没做功课吗
Am I the only one who did the reading?

787
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,470
洛基需要什么特定能源吗
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

788
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,280
他得把魔方加热到1.2亿开
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

789
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,990
才能突破库仑势垒
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

790
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,490
除非  塞尔维格已经想出
Unless Selvig has figured out

791
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,720
稳定量子隧穿效应的方法
how to stabilise the quantum tunnelling effect.

792
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,590
如果他想出来了
Well, if he could do that,

793
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,550
就能用任何一个反应堆实现重离子束聚变
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

794
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,240
终于有个说人话的了
Finally, someone who speaks English.

795
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,700
是这样吗
Is that what just happened?

796
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,170
幸会  班纳博士
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

797
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,830
你对反电子碰撞的研究真是无与伦比
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

798
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,010
而且我觉得你失去控制
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

799
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:24,260
变身狂暴巨怪的样子更是赞
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

800
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,470
-谢谢  -班纳博士来这里只是为了追踪魔方
- Thanks. - Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.

801
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,900
我希望你能和他一起合作
I was hoping you might join him.

802
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,180
从他的权杖入手吧
I would start with that stick of his.

803
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:32,930
不管有没有魔力
It may be magical,

804
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,860
它的运作方式很像九头蛇的武器
but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.

805
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,200
这我不了解  但权杖的力量来自魔方
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

806
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,100
我还想知道
And I would like to know

807
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,800
洛基是怎么用它  把我认识的最机敏的两个人
how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know

808
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,090
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}出自《绿野仙踪》

809
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,090
变成了他自己的飞猴
into his personal flying monkeys.

810
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,790
-什么飞猴  我没懂  -我懂
- Monkeys? I do not understand. - I do.

811
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,650
我知道这个梗
I understood that reference.

812
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,140
我们开工吧  博士
Shall we play, Doctor?

813
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,300
这边走  先生
This way, sir.

814
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,590
伽马读数与塞尔维格对宇宙魔方的报告
The gamma readings are definitely consistent with

815
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,670
完全相符
Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

816
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,700
但处理数据要几周时间
But it's going to take weeks to process.

817
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,980
如果我们绕过他们的主机
If we bypass their mainframe

818
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,350
直接连接主模块
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

819
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,800
速度就能达到每秒六百万亿次浮点运算
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

820
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,880
我只带了个牙刷
All I packed was a toothbrush.

821
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,560
你该抽空到斯塔克大厦来
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

822
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,060
最高10层都是研究开发部
Top ten floors, all R&D.

823
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,620
你肯定喜欢  简直就是糖果乐园
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

824
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,620
谢了  不过我上次去纽约时
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

825
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,230
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《无敌浩克》

826
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,230
把哈莱姆区给砸烂了
I kind of broke Harlem.《无敌浩克》

827
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,210
我保证不给你压力
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

828
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,360
不紧张  也不吓唬你
No tension, no surprises.

829
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,290
这么淡定
Nothing?

830
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:45,330
你疯了吗
Are you nuts?

831
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,440
谁知道呢
Jury's out.

832
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,470
你还真能压得住火气  你有什么诀窍
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?

833
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,400
舒缓爵士乐  邦哥鼓  还是抽一大袋大麻
Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?

834
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,000
你把所有的事都当成笑话吗
Is everything a joke to you?

835
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,900
只有好笑的事
Funny things are.

836
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,320
危及航母上所有人的生命安全并不好笑
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.

837
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,840
-无意冒犯  博士  -没关系
- No offence, Doc. - It's all right,

838
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,440
我要是连这都受不住  也不会来了
I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.

839
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,800
你太小心了  大块头
You're tip-toeing, big man.

840
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,600
你该放开点
You need to strut.

841
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,440
而你该专心解决问题  斯塔克先生
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.

842
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,560
你觉得我没有吗
Do you think I'm not?

843
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,120
弗瑞为什么现在才找我们  而不是之前
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

844
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,010
他对我们隐瞒了什么
What isn't he telling us?

845
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,350
信息不全  我就无法解答
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

846
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,730
你是说弗瑞有什么没告诉我们吗
You think Fury's hiding something?

847
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:20,000
他是间谍  队长  他是间谍之王
He's a spy. Captain, he's "The" Spy.

848
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,480
他的秘密会下崽
His secrets have secrets.

849
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,450
你也在琢磨这事  对吧
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

850
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,070
我只想完成手头的工作...
I just want to finish my work here, and...

851
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,200
博士
Doctor?

852
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,980
为全人类点亮一盏明灯
"A warm light for all mankind."

853
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,230
关于魔方  洛基挖苦弗瑞的那句话
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

854
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,020
我也听到了
I heard it.

855
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,830
我认为他是在指你
I think that was meant for you.

856
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:46,600
即使巴顿没告诉洛基斯塔克大厦的事
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

857
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,070
新闻上也到处都是了
it was still all over the news.

858
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,440
斯塔克大厦
The Stark Tower?

859
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,610
就是纽约那幢又大又丑...的大楼吗
That big, ugly building in New York?

860
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,750
为大楼供能的方舟反应堆是自给能源
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

861
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:59,070
那栋大楼一年内都不需要外部能源吧
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

862
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,470
那还只是个原型
It's just the prototype.

863
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,400
我算是当今清洁能源界的唯一人
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

864
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,290
他就是这个意思
That's what he's getting at.

865
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,810
所以  神盾局为什么
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D.

866
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,670
不把他招进宇宙魔方计划
bring him in on the Tesseract project?

867
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:11,020
更何况  他们为什么要染指能源业
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

868
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,670
我应该调查一下
I should probably look into that

869
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,280
等我的解密程序破解了
once my decryption programme finishes

870
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,670
所有的神盾局加密文件
breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

871
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,420
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry. Did you say...

872
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,710
我一到舰桥  贾维斯就开始运行破解程序了
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

873
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:20,380
只要几个小时  我就能知道
In a few hours, I'll know

874
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,750
神盾局内部所有不可告人的秘密
every dirty secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

875
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,350
吃蓝莓吗
Blueberry?

876
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:25,760
你还想不通为什么神盾局不让你加入吗
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

877
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,650
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}intelligence有智力和情报两种意思

878
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,650
情报部门的人还惧怕天才吗
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

879
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,440
可真是说不过去啊
Historically, not awesome.

880
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,870
我认为洛基是想让我们神经紧张
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

881
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,440
他可是要发动战争的人
This is a man who means to start a war

882
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,690
如果我们不能保持专注  他就得逞了
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

883
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,270
我们接到命令  就要服从
We have orders. We should follow them.

884
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,930
服从命令不是我的风格
Following's not really my style.

885
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,360
你只在乎你的风格  是吧
And you're all about style, aren't you?

886
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,950
这个房间里的人
Of the people in this room,

887
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,890
是谁  首先穿得花里胡哨
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

888
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,510
其次  根本毫无用处
and, B, not of use?

889
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:54,940
史蒂夫  你真的不觉得这有点奇怪吗
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

890
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,890
找到魔方就是了
Just find the Cube.

891
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,860
他就是我爸一直念念不忘的家伙吗
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

892
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,830
他们是不是继续把他冻着比较好
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

893
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,230
关于洛基他说得对
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

894
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,110
他确实胜我们一筹
He does have the jump on us.

895
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:24,360
他不过是有个看着挺唬人的炸弹
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

896
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,930
早晚会把他自己炸飞
It's going to blow up in his face.

897
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,860
到时候我就等着看好戏
And I'm going to be there when it does.

898
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,580
那我还是等着看报纸好了
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

899
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,650
或者你会和我们一起披挂上阵
Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

900
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,340
要知道  我可不穿盔甲
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

901
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,920
我就像神经一样暴露在外
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

902
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,230
简直是一场噩梦
It's a nightmare.

903
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,900
我身体里有一堆弹片
You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel

904
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,810
时刻都在往我心脏里爬
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.

905
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,370
被这个挡住了
This stops it.

906
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,600
这个小小的光环  它已经是我的一部分了
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

907
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,610
而不仅仅是盔甲
not just armour.

908
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,550
这是种可怕的特权
It's a terrible privilege.

909
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,370
-可你能控制它  -因为我找到了方法
- But you can control it. - Because I learned how.

910
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,370
我们不一样
It's different.

911
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,940
你的"意外事故"我都听说了
I read all about your accident.

912
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,580
你受了那么强的伽玛辐射  本该是死定了
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

913
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,680
所以你是说绿巨人...
So you're saying that the Hulk...

914
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,250
那个家伙救了我吗
The other guy saved my life?

915
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,370
不错
That's nice.

916
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:23,950
这么想挺好  可他为什么要救我
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

917
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,560
也许以后就知道了
I guess we'll find out.

918
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,890
那个答案你未必喜欢
You may not enjoy that.

919
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,030
但你也许会喜欢
And you just might.

920
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,400
{\an8}安全仓库

921
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,260
洛基带走了博士之后
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

922
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,870
我们转移了简·福斯特
we moved Jane Foster.

923
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,720
特罗瑟姆[挪威城市]有座很好的天文台
They've got an excellent observatory in Troms?

924
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,860
昨天突然有人请她去做顾问
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

925
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,960
酬金不菲  搭乘私人飞机  地处偏远
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

926
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,140
她不会有事
She'll be safe.

927
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,230
谢谢
Thank you.

928
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,990
洛基带走艾瑞克·塞尔维格绝非偶然
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

929
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,600
等洛基达成目的  还不知会如何对他
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

930
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,490
艾瑞克是个好人
Erik is a good man.

931
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:58,990
他经常说起你
He talks about you a lot.

932
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,710
你改变了他的生活
You changed his life.

933
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,020
你还改变了这里的一切
You changed everything around here.

934
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,640
还是保持原样的好
They were better as they were.

935
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,760
在阿斯加德  我们自视高人一等
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

936
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,730
却像俾施泰姆一样来这胡作非为
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

937
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,700
-像什么  -俾施泰姆
- Like what? - Bilge snipe.

938
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,810
就是那种有鳞甲和大角的巨兽
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

939
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,570
-地球上没有吗  -应该没有
- You don't have those? - I don't think so.

940
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,140
那东西很可恶
Well, they are repulsive.

941
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,930
途经之地万物尽毁
And they trample everything in their path.

942
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,210
我第一次来地球时  引来了洛基的愤怒
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

943
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,090
人类为此遭受劫难
and your people paid the price.

944
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,760
现在历史又重演
And now, again.

945
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,970
年少无知的我渴望战争
In my youth, I courted war.

946
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,830
战争还没开始呢
War hasn't started yet.

947
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,560
你能从洛基口中问出宇宙魔方的下落吗
You think you could make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?

948
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,880
不知道  洛基的心思深不可测
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

949
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:03,970
他不仅渴望权力  还想要报复我
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

950
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:07,340
任何痛苦都不能让他放弃自己的野心
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

951
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,840
很多人都曾这么认为
A lot of guys think that

952
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,430
直到他们尝到真正的痛苦
until the pain starts.

953
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,800
你要我做什么
What are you asking me to do?

954
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,470
我要问你  你愿意做什么
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

955
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,680
洛基现在是犯人
Loki is a prisoner.

956
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,450
但我为什么觉得
Then why do I feel like

957
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,930
他是唯一想待在这艘航母上的人
he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?

958
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,040
能偷偷接近我的人可不多
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

959
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,150
可你猜到我会来
But you figured I'd come.

960
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:43,980
没这么早
After.

961
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,860
我以为弗瑞在用尽所有折磨后
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

962
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:52,390
才会派你来  假意友好  来安抚我
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

963
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,300
我就会合作了
And I would cooperate.

964
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,660
我想知道你对巴顿特工做了什么
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

965
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,050
我开拓了他的心智
I would say I've expanded his mind.

966
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:03,560
等你赢了
And once you've won,

967
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,670
等你成了王
once you're king of the mountain,

968
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,300
他的心智会怎么样
what happens to his mind?

969
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,120
你爱他吗  罗曼诺夫特工
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

970
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,840
小孩子才说爱  我是欠他人情
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

971
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,510
说来听听
Tell me.

972
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,070
我进神盾局之前  我...
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...

973
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,880
我早已声名远扬
Well, I made a name for myself.

974
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:39,100
我有着独特的技能
I have a very specific skill set.

975
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:43,270
我不在乎为谁工作  或是对付谁
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

976
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,880
我上了神盾局的黑名单
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

977
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,150
他们派巴顿特工来杀我
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

978
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,450
但他改了主意
He made a different call.

979
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,340
要是我保证放他一条生路  你要怎么回报我
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

980
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,600
我不会放了你
Not let you out.

981
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,910
我知道  可这多有趣
No, but I like this.

982
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,700
整个世界都危在旦夕  你却为一个人讨价还价
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

983
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,680
政权的颠覆司空见惯
Regimes fall every day.

984
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,250
我不会纠结这个  我可是俄罗斯人
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

985
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,540
以前是
Or I was.

986
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,270
那你现在又算什么
And what are you now?

987
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,080
其实这事没这么复杂
It's really not that complicated.

988
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:23,730
我欠了债  我想要偿还
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

989
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,110
你能吗
Can you?

990
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,060
那么多的债  你真的还得清吗
Can you wipe out that much red?

991
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,620
德雷科夫的女儿
Dreykov's daughter,

992
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,210
圣保罗
St Paulo,

993
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:40,630
医院的火灾
the hospital fire?

994
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:44,100
巴顿把一切都告诉我了
Barton told me everything.

995
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,980
你血债累累  沾满双手
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

996
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,730
你以为救一个比你强不到哪去的人
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

997
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,190
能改变什么吗
will change anything?

998
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,790
多廉价的多愁善感
This is the basest sentimentality.

999
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,470
就像在祈祷的孩子
This is a child at prayer.

1000
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,950
可悲至极
Pathetic!

1001
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,620
你欺骗  杀戮
You lie and kill

1002
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,570
为骗子和杀手服务
in the service of liars and killers.

1003
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,940
{\an8}发现病毒  非法入侵

1004
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:11,710
你自以为清高  遵循自己的准则
You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,

1005
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:13,900
粉饰你所犯下的罪行
something that makes up for the horrors.

1006
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,990
但那是你的一部分
But they are part of you.

1007
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:21,200
永远无法抹去
And they will never go away.

1008
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:26,010
我会留着巴顿  我会让他杀了你
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

1009
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,460
他深知你的恐惧
Slowly, intimately,

1010
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,850
他会一点一点亲手杀了你
in every way he knows you fear.

1011
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,180
之后我再唤醒他  给他时间欣赏自己的杰作
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

1012
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,880
等他痛苦哀嚎的时候  我再要了他的命
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1013
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:40,510
这就是我还的价  你这没用的婊子
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

1014
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,590
你是个怪物
You're a monster.

1015
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,340
不
Oh, no.

1016
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,340
怪物是你带来的
You brought the monster.

1017
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,950
所以是班纳
So, Banner.

1018
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,960
那就是你的计划
That's your play.

1019
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,360
什么
What?

1020
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,680
洛基想要让绿巨人变身
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1021
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,350
别让班纳出实验室  我马上就到
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1022
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,820
让托尔也过去
Send Thor as well.

1023
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,360
谢谢你的合作
Thank you for your cooperation.

1024
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:18,290
你在干什么  斯塔克先生
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1025
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,610
我也想问你同样的问题
Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

1026
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,540
你该去搜寻宇宙魔方的下落
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

1027
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,960
没错  搜索模型已经锁定
We are. The model's locked

1028
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,660
正在扫描搜索信号
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1029
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,770
一有结果
When we get a hit,

1030
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,860
就能把范围缩小到半英里内
we'll have the location within half a mile.

1031
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,500
嗯  然后你就能拿回魔方  稍安毋躁
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1032
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,750
二阶是什么
What is "Phase 2"?

1033
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,640
二阶是神盾局利用魔方制造武器
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

1034
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,510
抱歉  电脑对我来说太慢了
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

1035
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:44,350
罗杰斯  我们搜集所有与宇宙魔方有关的东西
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

1036
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,120
这不代表我们...
This does not mean that we're making...

1037
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,560
不好意思  尼克
I'm sorry, Nick.

1038
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,210
你还有什么好说的吗
What were you lying?

1039
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:50,820
我错了  局长
I was wrong, Director.

1040
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,090
这个世界还是一点没变
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1041
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,200
这事你知道吗
Did you know about this?

1042
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:53,870
你要不要
You want to think about

1043
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,060
离开这里  博士
removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?

1044
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,290
我本在加尔各答[印]  离这远着呢
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

1045
01:07:58,290 --> 01:07:59,670
洛基在操控你
Loki is manipulating you.

1046
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:01,100
那你一直以来做的又是什么
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1047
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,110
你肯来不是被我的魅力折服才来的
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

1048
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:05,710
对  我也不会因为你突然神经质了就走
Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1049
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,650
我要知道神盾局为什么
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1050
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,040
利用宇宙魔方开发大规模杀伤性武器
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

1051
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:13,100
因为他
Because of him.

1052
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,580
我
Me?

1053
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,720
去年   一个外星人来到地球
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

1054
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,090
引发了一场恶战  结果移平了一座小镇
who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.

1055
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,510
我们不仅知道了宇宙中有其他生命存在
We learned that not only are we not alone

1056
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:28,200
还发现我们的战斗力远远不及他们
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

1057
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,430
我的人民只想与地球和平相处
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

1058
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:32,450
可你们不是唯一的外星生命吧
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

1059
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,800
你们也不是唯一的威胁
And you're not the only threat.

1060
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,870
宇宙中充满了比我们强大的生物
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

1061
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,890
没有人能控制他们
that can't be controlled.

1062
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,070
就像你们控制不了魔方吗
Like you controlled the Cube?

1063
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,410
你们利用宇宙魔方制造武器
Your work with the Tesseract

1064
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,100
才会招来洛基和他的同伙
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1065
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,710
这是给其他种族发出的信号
It is a signal to all the realms

1066
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:49,590
宣告地球准备好展开高级战争
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

1067
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:50,690
高级
A higher form?

1068
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,100
这是无奈之举
You forced our hand.

1069
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,730
我们必须有所准备
We had to come up with something.

1070
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:53,950
"核威慑"
A nuclear deterrent.

1071
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,230
因为那样总能平息所有事态
Because that always calms everything right down.

1072
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,770
别忘了你们家族的发家史  斯塔克
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

1073
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,830
如果斯塔克还在造军火  他肯定也脱不了...
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

1074
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,000
等等  矛头怎么指向我了
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1075
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,190
怎么  你不总是焦点吗
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1076
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,400
我以为人类要比这文明
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

1077
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,000
不好意思  人类跑去你的星球捣乱了吗
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

1078
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,200
你居然这么不信任你们的守护者
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

1079
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,830
你们怎么这么幼稚
Are you boys really that naive?

1080
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:14,860
神盾局会监视所有潜在威胁
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1081
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,330
美国队长也是威胁吗
Captain America's on threat watch?

1082
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:17,250
我们都是
We all are.

1083
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,560
等等  你也上黑名单了吗
Wait, you're on that list?

1084
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,550
你和愤怒的蜜蜂[游戏]谁更靠前
Are you above or below angry bees?

1085
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,610
斯塔克  我发誓  你要是再说一句俏皮话...
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

1086
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,190
你这是口头恐吓  我感到威胁了
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1087
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,980
-放尊重点  -尊重什么
- Show some respect. - Respect what?

1088
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,320
66B号运输机  请说确认口令
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

1089
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,430
系统里有你的资料  但没有航行记录
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

1090
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:41,190
请上报运输货物  完毕
What is your haul? Over.

1091
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,800
武器弹药  完毕
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1092
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,130
你口口声声说要控制  却崇尚混乱
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

1093
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,460
这就是他的作风  不是吗
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1094
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,070
我们算是团队吗
I mean, what are we, a team?

1095
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,130
不  我们在一起只会产生混乱
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

1096
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,280
我们...就是个定时炸弹
We're a time bomb.

1097
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,260
你最好别插嘴
You need to step away.

1098
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:07,170
他为什么就不能发泄一下呢
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

1099
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,220
这你清楚得很  少胡闹
You know damn well why. Back off!

1100
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,370
我倒想看看你有没有本事让我不闹
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1101
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:14,670
是吗  你只是穿着铁甲威风罢了
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1102
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,410
没有铁甲  你又算什么
Take that off, what are you?

1103
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:20,190
超级天才  亿万富翁  花心萝卜  慈善人士
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

1104
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,920
我认识很多人  即使没有这些也比你强上十倍
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

1105
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,000
我看过关于你的资料
I've seen the footage.

1106
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,370
你只在乎你自己
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

1107
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,410
你不会做出牺牲
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

1108
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,170
不会匍在铁丝网上让战友爬过去
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

1109
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,830
要是我就剪断铁丝网
I think I would just cut the wire.

1110
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:39,320
总是有歪门邪道
Always a way out.

1111
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,510
你也许不是威胁
You may not be a threat

1112
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:43,760
但你最好别再充英雄了
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

1113
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,920
英雄  你那样的英雄吗
A hero? Like you?

1114
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,370
你就是个实验品  罗杰斯
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1115
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,450
你的一切超凡也不过是一瓶血清给的
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

1116
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:19,700
穿上铁甲  我们来战
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1117
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:24,930
你们人类真渺小
You people are so petty and tiny.

1118
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:25,820
这也叫团队
Yeah, this is a team.

1119
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,410
罗曼诺夫特工  请你护送
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1120
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,420
班纳博士回他的...
Dr Banner back to his...

1121
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,510
去哪  你把我的房间给别人了
Where? You rented my room.

1122
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:31,910
那个囚室只是以防...
The cell was just in case...

1123
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,470
以防你必须杀我
In case you needed to kill me.

1124
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:36,000
但你杀不了我  我知道  我自己试过
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1125
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,250
我很低落  看不到出路
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1126
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,890
所以我吞枪自杀  而那家伙把子弹吐了出来
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

1127
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,450
所以我活了下去
So I moved on.

1128
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,650
专注于帮助别人  我本来很好
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

1129
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,230
直到你们把我拉来这场闹剧
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

1130
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:55,610
还危及所有人的安全
and put everyone here at risk.

1131
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,440
你不是想知道我有什么诀窍吗  罗曼诺夫特工
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

1132
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,400
我怎么保持冷静的诀窍
You want to know how I stay calm?

1133
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,340
班纳博士
Dr Banner,

1134
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:06,510
放下权杖
put down the sceptre.

1135
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,100
{\an8}搜索中...

1136
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,300
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  94%

1137
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:12,970
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  95%

1138
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:16,360
找到了
Got it.

1139
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:18,290
抱歉  伙计们
Sorry, kids,

1140
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,430
你们没机会看我亮绝活了
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

1141
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,570
找到宇宙魔方了吗
You located the Tesseract?

1142
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,390
我能更快赶过去
I could get there fastest.

1143
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,770
宇宙魔方是阿斯加德的  人类无法控制
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

1144
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:26,380
-你不能自己去  -你要阻止我吗
- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?

1145
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,400
等你穿上铁甲再说
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1146
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,910
打老年人我毫无压力
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1147
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:30,100
快穿上铁甲
Put on the suit.

1148
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:31,410
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  98%

1149
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,160
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  99%

1150
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:32,500
{\an8}能量信号匹配度  100%

1151
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:33,740
天啊
Oh, my God.

1152
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:50,870
去穿铁甲
Put on the suit.

1153
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:51,820
听你的
Yeah.

1154
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:56,680
全员就位
All hands to stations.

1155
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,700
-希尔  -航母外部发生爆炸
- Hill! - External detonation.

1156
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,290
-3号引擎停机  -我们遭到了袭击
- Number three engine is down. - We've been hit.

1157
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,140
-能修好吗  -3号引擎失火
- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!

1158
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,540
-什么情况  -涡轮机还算完好
- Talk to me. - Turbine looks mostly intact

1159
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,540
但我们在飞行状态下
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs

1160
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,750
无法进入故障区维修
while we're in the air.

1161
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,280
再失去一个引擎我们就要坠毁了
If we lose one more engine we won't be.

1162
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,950
派人出去修理引擎
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

1163
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,640
-斯塔克  听到了吗  -我这就去
- Stark, you copy that? - I'm on it.

1164
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,030
科尔森  启动关押区防御性封锁
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section,

1165
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,530
再去军械库
then get to the armoury.

1166
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,620
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff?

1167
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,930
我们没事
We're okay.

1168
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,110
没事的吧
We're okay, right?

1169
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:48,340
-别让引擎启动  -是  长官
- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir.

1170
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,980
去关押区  先关闭摄像头
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1171
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,200
-是  -跟我来

到第4层
Let's go, Level 4.

1173
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,020
3号引擎  那边见
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1174
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,980
博士
Doctor?

1175
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:11,550
布鲁斯
Bruce?

1176
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,960
你得挺住  不能正中洛基下怀
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

1177
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,480
我们不会有事的  听我说
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1178
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:19,760
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

1179
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,820
不会有事  好吗
We're going to be okay. All right?

1180
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,430
我用生命发誓  我一定会救你出去
I swear on my life I will get you out of this.

1181
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,180
你不会再被牵扯进来  再也不...
You will walk away and never ever...

1182
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,180
你的命
Your life?

1183
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,040
布鲁斯
Bruce.

1184
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:28,520
调转航母  航向180  向南行进
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1185
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,850
-把航母开向海面  -我们在盲目飞行
- Take us to the water! - We're flying blind.

1186
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,860
引擎故障后  导航系统重置了
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

1187
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,690
天上有太阳吗
Is the sun coming up?

1188
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,000
-有  长官  -那就在太阳右边飞
- Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left.

1189
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,650
开往海面
Get us over water.

1190
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:42,030
再有涡轮熄火就要坠毁了
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

1191
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,850
谢谢
Thanks.

1192
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,670
斯塔克
Stark!

1193
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:53,770
斯塔克  我来了
Stark, I'm here!

1194
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:55,310
很好
Good.

1195
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,140
看看是什么情况
Let's see what we've got.

1196
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:02,100
我得先修复超导冷却系统
I got to get this superconducting coolant system back online

1197
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,650
之后才能进入转轮
before I can access the rotors,

1198
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,440
清理残骸
work on dislodging the debris.

1199
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,550
你去引擎控制面板那里
I need you to get to that engine control panel

1200
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:11,870
告诉我哪些继电器过载了
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

1201
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,110
你看到了什么
What does it look like in there?

1202
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,290
电力设备
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

1203
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:32,130
嗯  你也没说错
Well, you're not wrong.

1204
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,890
我们不是敌人  班纳
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1205
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,720
快清醒过来
Try to think!

1206
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,900
好  继电器正常了
Okay, the relays are intact.

1207
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,670
接下来怎么做
What's our next move?

1208
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:54,770
就算我清理了残骸
Even if I clear the rotors,

1209
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,980
没有助力  转轮也无法重新启动
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1210
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,680
我得进去推着它转
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1211
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,640
转速上升了你就会被切碎
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

1212
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,760
定子控制器
That stator control unit

1213
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,070
能翻转磁极
can reverse the polarity long enough

1214
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:04,400
直至磁悬浮解除  就能...
to disengage maglev and that could...

1215
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,790
说人话
Speak English!

1216
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,620
看到红色控制杆了吗
You see that red lever?

1217
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,680
它能让转轮减速  给我飞出来的时间
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

1218
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,830
待在那里  等我指令
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1219
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,210
撤离下层机库甲板上的全部人员
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1220
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,350
小心手雷
Grenade!

1221
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,850
有人入侵
We've got a perimeter breach!

1222
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,740
敌人身着神盾局装备
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1223
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,270
全员注意
Call-outs at every junction.

1224
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:42,710
绿巨人和托尔在4层研发层
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

1225
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,280
2层和3层的摄像头被破坏
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1226
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,370
长官  绿巨人会把这里彻底毁掉
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1227
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,880
那就吸引他的注意力
Get his attention.

1228
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,750
60护航机前往Y型区  火力牵制敌人
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

1229
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,460
保持距离
Don't get too close.

1230
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,510
收到
Copy.

1231
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:08,930
锁定目标
Target acquired.

1232
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,770
开火
Target engaged.

1233
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:28,150
目标火了  他发火了
Target angry, target angry!

1234
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:38,950
你们不可能通过这道门  究竟想...
You're not getting through here, so what the hell...

1235
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,970
{\an8}1号引擎出现故障

1236
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,570
1号引擎停机了
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1237
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:09,530
我们正在失控下坠
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1238
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:11,960
长官  1号引擎彻底停转
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

1239
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,950
是巴顿  他毁了我们的系统
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

1240
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,830
他去关押层了
He's headed for the detention level.

1241
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,990
有人收到吗
Does anybody copy?

1242
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,240
我是罗曼诺夫特工
This is Agent Romanoff.

1243
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,090
我收到了
I copy.

1244
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,320
斯塔克  航母在下坠
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1245
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,760
嗯  发现了
Yeah, I noticed.

1246
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:00,770
不
No!

1247
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:10,660
你还能不能吸取教训了
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1248
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:55,920
人类认为我们是不死之身
The humans think us immortal.

1249
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,650
那就检验一下吧
Should we test that?

1250
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,740
请你退到一边去
Move away, please.

1251
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,240
你喜欢吗
You like this?

1252
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:12,890
你派来毁灭者后  我们研发了这个原型机
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

1253
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:15,840
我都不清楚它的威力
Even I don't know what it does.

1254
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,490
你想试试看吗
Do you want to find out?

1255
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,140
不
No!

1256
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:32,620
塔莎
Tasha?

1257
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,930
你输定了
You're going to lose.

1258
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,440
是吗
Am I?

1259
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,300
因为你的本性
It's in your nature.

1260
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,320
你们那些英雄已经分崩离析
Your heroes are scattered.

1261
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:21,260
你们的飞行堡垒也将要坠落
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1262
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,600
我还有什么好担心的
Where is my disadvantage?

1263
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,920
你没有信念
You lack conviction.

1264
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,430
我觉得我...
I don't think I'm...

1265
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,510
威力不小嘛
So, that's what it does.

1266
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,510
{\an8}高度

1267
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,810
队长  扳控制杆
Cap, hit the lever.

1268
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,360
等我一下
I need a minute here!

1269
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:14,440
扳控制杆
Lever

1270
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:15,830
快点
now!

1271
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:28,790
救命
Help!

1272
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,600
对不起  头儿
Sorry, boss.

1273
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,480
被那神逃走了
The god rabbited.

1274
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,270
保持清醒
Just stay awake.

1275
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,130
看着我
Eyes on me.

1276
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,990
不行了  我得离岗了
No, I'm clocking out here.

1277
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:14,270
我不批准
Not an option.

1278
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,810
没关系  头儿
It's okay, boss.

1279
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,810
想要他们成为真正的团队
This was never gonna work

1280
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,140
就得给他们点...
if they didn't have something

1281
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,070
动...
to...

1282
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,450
科尔森特工负伤了
Agent Coulson is down.

1283
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,820
医疗队赶过去了
A medical team is on its way to your location.

1284
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:00,870
他们已经到了
They're here.

1285
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,570
他们宣布死亡了
They called it.

1286
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,850
这是在菲尔·科尔森外套口袋里找到的
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1287
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,850
看来他没来得及找你要签名
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1288
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,900
我们现在完全停摆
We're dead in the air up here.

1289
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:37,720
通讯中断  魔方不知所踪
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

1290
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,530
班纳和托尔也下落不明
Banner, Thor...

1291
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,370
我已经山穷水尽了
I got nothing for you.

1292
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:46,180
还失去了最得力的属下
I lost my one good eye.

1293
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,340
也许这是我活该
Maybe I had that coming.

1294
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,080
没错
Yes,

1295
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:02,880
我们是想利用宇宙魔方制造武器
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1296
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:06,400
但我并没有将所有希望放在这个上面
I never put all my chips on that number, though,

1297
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,980
因为我还有个更大胆的计划
because I was playing something even riskier.

1298
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:17,390
我有个设想  这事斯塔克知道
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1299
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,080
叫做"复仇者计划"
called the Avengers Initiative.

1300
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:28,350
是将一些能力超群的人聚集在一起
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people

1301
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,960
看他们组成的团队是不是更强大
to see if they could become something more.

1302
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:36,990
看他们是不是能在危急时刻并肩战斗
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

1303
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:40,260
去打赢那些我们赢不了的战争
to fight the battles that we never could.

1304
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,410
菲尔·科尔森到死都相信这个设想
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

1305
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:52,280
他相信英雄
In heroes.

1306
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,070
好吧
Well,

1307
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,700
这个观念是过时了
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1308
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,270
你从天上掉下来
You fell out of the sky.

1309
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,240
我伤着谁了吗
Did I hurt anybody?

1310
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:47,060
这附近也没人给你伤
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1311
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:50,480
不过你倒是把鸽子都吓坏了
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

1312
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,060
那真走运
Lucky.

1313
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:55,030
或许是你瞄得准
Or just good aim.

1314
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,710
落下来的时候你还醒着呢
You were awake when you fell.

1315
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:00,520
-你都看见了吗  -都看到了
- You saw? - The whole thing.

1316
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:02,420
你穿透屋顶摔下来
Right through the ceiling.

1317
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,980
又大又绿还光着屁股
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1318
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:07,590
给
Here.

1319
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:10,170
本来没觉得你能穿上这个
Didn't think those would fit you

1320
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,180
直到你缩小到普通人的身材
until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.

1321
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:17,090
谢谢
Thank you.

1322
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:19,750
你是外星人吗
Are you an alien?

1323
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,150
什么
What?

1324
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:23,430
你是外太空来的人吗
From outer space, an alien.

1325
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,710
不是
No.

1326
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:28,380
这样啊  那你可病得不轻啊  孩子
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1327
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:41,700
克林特  你不会有事的
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1328
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:45,800
是吗
You know that?

1329
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:48,970
你确定吗
Is that what you know?

1330
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:54,760
我不能松懈
I've got no window.

1331
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:57,260
我得把他赶出去
I have to flush him out.

1332
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,900
你得稳定下来  这需要时间
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

1333
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:01,330
你不明白
You don't understand.

1334
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:06,320
你知道被人夺去意志  肆意摆布的滋味吗
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

1335
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:10,900
把你的意识排除在外  塞进另一个自己
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1336
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:16,720
你知道那种被摧毁的感觉吗
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1337
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,060
你知道我明白那种感觉
You know that I do.

1338
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,100
我怎么恢复的
Why am I back?

1339
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,960
你怎么把他弄走的
How did you get him out?

1340
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:34,350
我重校准了你的意识
Cognitive recalibration.

1341
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:36,980
就是狠狠地砸了你的脑袋
I hit you really hard on the head.

1342
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,470
谢谢
Thanks.

1343
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,520
娜塔莎
Natasha...

1344
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,010
我杀了多少特...
How many agents did I...

1345
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:47,910
别
Don't.

1346
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:50,790
别这么折磨自己  克林特
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1347
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,610
错的是洛基
This is Loki.

1348
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,940
是怪物和魔法
This is monsters and magic,

1349
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,070
是我们从未对付过的敌人
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1350
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:59,780
洛基  他跑了吗
Loki, did he get away?

1351
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:00,700
是的
Yeah.

1352
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,490
你知道他去哪里了吗
I don't suppose you know where.

1353
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,440
这我不需要知道
I didn't need to know.

1354
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:06,200
我没问
I didn't ask.

1355
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,240
不过他很快就会行动
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1356
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,300
就在今天
Today.

1357
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,550
我们得阻止他
We got to stop him.

1358
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,380
是吗  我们都有谁
Yeah? Who's "We"?

1359
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:19,540
不知道  还剩下的人吧
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1360
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,520
嗯
Well,

1361
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,800
要是我能一箭射穿洛基的眼窝
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

1362
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,160
应该就能睡个好觉了
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1363
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,000
这话才像你
Now you sound like you.

1364
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:34,900
可你不像你
But you don't.

1365
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:39,830
你是间谍  不是战士
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1366
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:44,600
现在你却要去冲锋陷阵  为什么
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1367
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:48,150
洛基把你怎么了
What did Loki do to you?

1368
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,240
没怎么  我只是...
He didn't. I just...

1369
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,610
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1370
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:01,070
我被他动摇了
I've been compromised.

1371
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,180
我欠了债
I got red in my ledger.

1372
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,090
我想要还债
I would like to wipe it out.

1373
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,740
他结婚了吗
Was he married?

1374
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:29,270
没有
No.

1375
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:34,620
有个女友  好像是大提琴手
There was a cellist, I think.

1376
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:36,690
真可惜
I'm sorry.

1377
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:39,240
他看着人不错
He seemed like a good man.

1378
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,890
他就是个笨蛋
He was an idiot.

1379
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:44,010
为什么  因为他有信仰吗
Why? For believing?

1380
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,590
因为他单独去对付洛基
For taking on Loki alone.

1381
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,390
那叫尽职尽责
He was doing his job.

1382
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,500
那叫自不量力  他该等待支援
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

1383
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,570
他该...
He should have...

1384
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,350
有时候没有别的选择  托尼
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1385
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,290
是啊  这话真耳熟
Right, I've heard that before.

1386
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:57,200
这是你第一次失去战友吗
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1387
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,960
我们不是战士
We are not soldiers.

1388
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:05,230
我不会听令于弗瑞
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1389
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,480
我也不会
Neither am I.

1390
01:36:06,490 --> 01:36:08,840
他也该为洛基犯下的罪行负责
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

1391
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:10,390
但现在我们必须既往不咎
But right now, we got to put that behind us

1392
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,970
共同对付外敌
and get this done.

1393
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,200
洛基需要一个能量源
Loki needs a power source.

1394
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:14,820
要是我们能列出...
If we can put together a list...

1395
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:15,920
他把战争变成了私仇
He made it personal.

1396
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,240
那不是重点
That's not the point.

1397
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,780
这就是重点  这就是洛基的目的
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1398
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,950
他为什么要直捣我们的老巢
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1399
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,660
为了击溃我们
To tear us apart.

1400
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:24,790
是啊  分散击破的确很聪明
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1401
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:27,480
但他知道他必须要铲除我们
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

1402
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,940
这才是他的目的
That's what he wants.

1403
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:31,600
他要打败我们  还要别人看到
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

1404
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,170
他想要观众
He wants an audience.

1405
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,290
对  我在斯图加特就碰上他的表演
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1406
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,010
没错  那只是试映
Yeah, that was just previews.

1407
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:38,580
这可是首演之夜
This is opening night.

1408
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:41,050
而洛基就是这场华丽闹剧的主角
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1409
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:42,940
他渴望鲜花和掌声
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1410
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:46,200
他要一座高耸入云的纪念碑  上面刻着他的名字
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

1411
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:49,460
我靠
Son of a bitch.

1412
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:58,870
{\an8}斯塔克

1413
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,290
该走了
Time to go.

1414
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:04,140
-去哪里  -路上说
- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.

1415
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:05,550
你会开飞机吗
Can you fly one of those jets?

1416
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:07,640
我会
I can.

1417
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:13,100
你有战斗服吗
You got a suit?

1418
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:14,110
有
Yeah.

1419
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,180
那就换装
Then suit up.

1420
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,840
未经允许你们不能登机
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

1421
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,070
孩子  别说了
Son, just don't.

1422
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:50,060
长官
Sir.

1423
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,310
希尔特工
Agent Hill.

1424
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:53,190
那些卡片
Those cards,

1425
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,120
是放在科尔森的衣柜里  而不是外套
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

1426
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,830
他们需要点动力
They needed the push.

1427
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:11,970
6号停机坪有人私自起飞
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

1428
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,500
他们找到洛基了
They found him.

1429
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:17,230
想尽一切办法恢复通讯
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

1430
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,450
-我要监控全局  -是  长官
- I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir.

1431
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:36,130
先生  我关闭了方舟反应堆
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1432
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:39,550
但那个装置已经自续供能了
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1433
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,810
关掉它  塞尔维格博士
Shut it down, Dr Selvig.

1434
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:44,060
太迟了
It's too late!

1435
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,530
她停不下来了
She can't stop now.

1436
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,450
她有东西要给我们看
She wants to show us something!

1437
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,770
一个新宇宙
A new universe.

1438
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:54,360
好吧
Okay.

1439
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:03,930
那层屏障是纯能量
The barrier is pure energy.

1440
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:05,800
无法打破
It's unbreachable.

1441
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:07,060
看出来了
Yeah, I got that.

1442
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:09,910
更换计划
Plan B.

1443
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:13,290
先生  马克7型还不能使用
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1444
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:15,390
那就不要轮子了  我们没时间了
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

1445
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:38,210
你是来求我开恩的吧
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

1446
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:41,300
其实我是来威胁你的
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1447
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,650
那你可不该把铁甲脱了
You should have left your armour on for that.

1448
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:44,540
是啊
Yeah.

1449
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,140
那一身穿得有些旧了
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1450
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,280
你还拿着金闪闪的命运之杖呢
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1451
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:50,830
来一杯吗
Would you like a drink?

1452
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,400
拖时间也没有用
Stalling me won't change anything.

1453
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:54,710
不不不  是威胁
No, no. Threatening.

1454
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,960
你真的不喝吗
No drink? Are you sure?

1455
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,350
我可要来一杯
I'm having one.

1456
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:03,560
齐塔瑞大军要来了  谁都无法阻止
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

1457
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:05,930
我还怕什么
What have I to fear?

1458
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,210
复仇者联盟
The Avengers.

1459
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,360
是我们自己起的名字  就是一队人
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

1460
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,150
地球最强英雄组合什么的
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1461
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,260
我见识过了
Yes, I've met them.

1462
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,370
好吧
Yeah.

1463
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,730
我承认磨合是要花些时间
It takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.

1464
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:21,960
不过我们还是来列一下吧
But let's do a head count, here.

1465
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:24,190
我们有你的半神哥哥
Your brother, the demigod,

1466
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,530
一个超级战士
a super soldier,

1467
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:30,170
不负盛名的不死传奇
a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

1468
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:33,380
一个有着严重愤怒管理问题的家伙
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

1469
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:36,620
一对顶级杀手  而你  好家伙
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

1470
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:39,890
你把他们所有人都惹毛了
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1471
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:41,270
这就是我的计划
That was the plan.

1472
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,420
不怎么明智
Not a great plan.

1473
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,620
等他们来了
When they come,

1474
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,550
他们肯定会来
and they will,

1475
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,220
他们会让你付出代价
they'll come for you.

1476
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:49,560
我有一支大军
I have an army.

1477
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:50,760
我们有绿巨人
We have a Hulk.

1478
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,780
那头野兽不是跑丢了吗
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1479
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,800
你搞错了重点  不会有王位的
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

1480
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,160
你是绝不可能获胜的
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

1481
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:01,270
或许你有军队要来  或许我们抵挡不了
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

1482
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,750
但一切都会算在你头上
but it's all on you.

1483
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,220
因为如果我们保护不了地球
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1484
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,350
你就等着我们来复仇吧
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1485
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,550
要是他们忙着对付你
How will your friends have time for me

1486
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,790
哪还有时间来战我
when they are so busy fighting you?

1487
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:24,120
以前都可以的
This usually works.

1488
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,180
性能失常什么的也算常见了
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

1489
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,340
五个男人就有一个...
One out of five...

1490
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,850
贾维斯  可以了
Jarvis, anytime now.

1491
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,920
你们都会败在我脚下
You will all fall before me.

1492
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,190
启动
Deploy!

1493
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:41,030
快启动
Deploy!

1494
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:10,760
你还惹毛了一个人
And there's one other person you pissed off.

1495
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,500
他的名字叫菲尔
His name was Phil.

1496
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,270
好吧
Right.

1497
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,890
大军来了
Army.

1498
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,450
洛基
Loki!

1499
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,950
关掉宇宙魔方  不然我就毁了它
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1500
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:56,970
你毁不掉
You can't.

1501
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:58,720
你无法阻止了
There is no stopping it.

1502
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,280
现在只有
There is only

1503
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:02,100
战争
the war.

1504
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:03,440
那就来吧
So be it.

1505
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,790
斯塔克  我们在你3点钟方向  航向东北
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

1506
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:29,460
什么  你们去买外卖了吗
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1507
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,860
去帕克大街  我引他们过去给你们当靶子
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

1508
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:51,140
先生  有更多敌人
Sir, we have more incoming.

1509
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,040
好吧  我们去会会他们
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1510
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:01,680
-小娜  -我看见他了
- Nat? - I see him.

1511
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,360
我们得到上面去
We got to get back up there.

1512
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,910
斯塔克  你看见这东西了吗
Stark, are you seeing this?

1513
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:44,300
看见了  但还在消化中
Seeing. Still working on believing.

1514
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:45,870
班纳出现了吗
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

1515
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,770
班纳
Banner?

1516
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,420
他到了就告诉我
Just keep me posted.

1517
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,400
贾维斯  找出它的弱点
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1518
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,660
你自己看看
Look at this!

1519
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,780
看看这一切
Look around you!

1520
01:46:57,410 --> 01:47:00,220
你以为你称了王  疯狂会就此结束吗
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1521
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:02,420
太迟了
It's too late.

1522
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,710
想阻止也来不及了
It's too late to stop it.

1523
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:09,040
不  只要我们一起就可以
No. We can, together.

1524
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,400
太天真了
Sentiment.

1525
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,050
有平民被困在里面了
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1526
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:50,460
洛基
Loki.

1527
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,470
他们在下面只有挨打的份
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1528
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,260
这边有我们  没问题  你去吧
We got this. It's good. Go.

1529
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:12,900
你能挡住他们吗
Do you think you can hold them off?

1530
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,130
队长
Captain,

1531
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:17,540
我非常乐意
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1532
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:47,870
这让我想到了布达佩斯那次
Just like Budapest all over again.

1533
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:50,470
我们对布达佩斯的回忆太不同了
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1534
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:09,230
集结国民警卫队需要一小时
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.

1535
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:10,260
国民警卫队
National Guard?

1536
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:13,890
军队知道这里发生了什么吗
Does the army know what's happening here?

1537
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,230
我们知道吗
Do we?

1538
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:17,360
派人到这些大楼里去
You need men in these buildings.

1539
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:18,660
楼里的人逃跑的时候
There are people inside and they're going to be running

1540
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,130
会被火力波及到
right into the line of fire.

1541
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,300
要带他们走地下室或是地铁
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

1542
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,020
别让他们到街上来
You keep them off the streets.

1543
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,730
封锁这里到39大街
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1544
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:28,860
我凭什么听你指挥
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1545
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:43,780
派人到这些大楼里去
I need men in those buildings.

1546
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:45,990
把人往地下带  别到街上来
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

1547
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:48,980
封锁这里到39大街
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

1548
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,910
好吧  它盯上我们了
Well, we got its attention.

1549
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:02,190
接下去怎么办
What the hell was step two?

1550
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,270
上面怎么样了
What's the story upstairs?

1551
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:35,340
包围魔方的能量无法穿透
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

1552
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,520
托尔说得对  我们得先对付这些怪物
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

1553
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:39,680
-怎么对付  -齐心协力
- How do we do this? - As a team.

1554
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:41,650
我和洛基还有帐要算
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1555
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:42,900
是吗  排个号吧
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1556
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:43,840
把力气省下来
Save it.

1557
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:45,410
洛基会集中兵力对付我们
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

1558
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:46,440
而我们正要他这样
and that's what we need.

1559
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,250
没有他的控制  它们会群魔无首
Without him, these things could run wild.

1560
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:50,800
斯塔克在上面  他会需要我们...
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

1561
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:02,310
那个  看起来真恐怖
So, this all seems horrible.

1562
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:04,260
我见过更恐怖的
I've seen worse.

1563
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:05,580
抱歉
Sorry.

1564
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:08,650
没关系  我们或许需要一点恐怖
No, we could use a little worse.

1565
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:11,210
-斯塔克  他来了  -班纳吗
- Stark, we got him. - Banner?

1566
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,390
被你说中了
Just like you said.

1567
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:15,720
让他武装起来  我这就把好戏拉过去
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1568
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:23,790
我不觉得这是什么好戏
I don't see how that's a party.

1569
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:32,720
班纳博士
Dr Banner.

1570
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:36,450
现在你最好生气起来了
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

1571
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,640
这就是我的诀窍  队长
That's my secret, Captain.

1572
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,550
我一直在生气
I'm always angry.

1573
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,150
撑住
Hold on!

1574
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,060
都派出来
Send the rest.

1575
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,760
快看
Guys.

1576
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:36,490
下命令吧  队长
Call it, Captain.

1577
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:37,760
好  都听好了
All right, listen up.

1578
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:40,410
在关掉传送门之前  想办法控制局面
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

1579
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,100
巴顿  我要你到那个屋顶上去
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1580
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,140
观察战场  报告敌军的动向
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1581
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:45,630
斯塔克  你守住封锁线
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1582
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:46,950
不要让这些怪物跑出三个街区
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

1583
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:48,640
挡不回去的直接轰成渣
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1584
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,940
-送我一程好吗  -好
- Can you give me a lift? - Right.

1585
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,390
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《魔戒》里擅长弓箭的精灵

1586
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,390
抓紧了  莱戈拉斯
Better clench up, Legolas.

1587
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,350
托尔  你得想办法堵上传送门
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

1588
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:58,400
拖慢它们的速度
Slow them down.

1589
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,940
你召唤闪电  劈死这群怪物
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

1590
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,570
你和我  我们守住地面
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

1591
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:05,830
牵制兵力
We keep the fighting here.

1592
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:07,000
绿巨人
And Hulk...

1593
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:10,670
使劲砸
Smash.

1594
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:05,170
长官
Sir.

1595
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,610
理事会在线上了
The Council is on.

1596
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,490
斯塔克  你后面跟了不少飞虫
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1597
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:19,490
我是不想让它们到街上去
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

1598
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:21,180
他们拐起弯来差劲得很
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1599
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:23,110
找个死角
So find a tight corner.

1600
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:24,790
收到
I will roger that.

1601
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,110
真烦人
Oh, boy.

1602
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:56,880
指挥得好
Nice call.

1603
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,630
还有什么
What else you got?

1604
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:01,070
托尔在6大街跟一支飞行队干起来了
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

1605
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:03,710
他居然不带我玩
And he didn't invite me.

1606
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,110
队长  如果不关上传送门
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

1607
01:55:45,110 --> 01:55:46,570
我们怎么打都是徒劳
if we don't close that portal.

1608
01:55:46,570 --> 01:55:48,090
最强的武器都穿不透它
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1609
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:49,680
也许是选的武器不对
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1610
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,570
你上去得搭个便车
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

1611
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:56,720
我有车搭
I got a ride.

1612
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,280
不过你得推我一把
I could use a boost, though.

1613
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:02,760
你确定吗
Are you sure about this?

1614
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:04,910
嗯  肯定很有趣
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1615
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:34,080
转弯  快转弯
Okay, turn, turn.

1616
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,740
收住  收住
Less! Less!

1617
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:01,660
队长  过麦迪逊大街的42街银行
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1618
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:03,680
有很多平民被敌人困在里面
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

1619
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:04,710
我这就去
I'm on it.

1620
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,120
大家让开
Everyone! Clear out!

1621
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:58,930
弗瑞局长
Director Fury,

1622
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,960
理事会已经做出决定
the Council has made a decision.

1623
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:04,070
这我知道了
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

1624
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:06,020
但鉴于这个决定蠢到家了
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1625
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:07,360
我决定无视
I have elected to ignore it.

1626
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,840
局长  你们比我们的潜艇离得都近
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

1627
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,020
立刻派出战机
You scramble that jet...

1628
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:15,030
那可是曼哈顿岛  理事
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1629
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:17,020
除非我的队伍确实撑不住了
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1630
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:20,800
不然我不会下令对平民实施核打击
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.

1631
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,230
如果不在这里挡住他们  那就无法挽回了
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

1632
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,600
如果投了核弹  那才真叫无法挽回
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1633
01:59:30,210 --> 01:59:31,120
是你啊
You.

1634
01:59:33,740 --> 01:59:34,650
鹰眼
Hawkeye!

1635
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:37,440
小娜  你干什么呢
Nat, what are you doing?

1636
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,360
帮下忙
A little help?

1637
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:45,890
放着我来
I got him.

1638
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:13,360
够了
Enough!

1639
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:15,780
你们都算什么东西
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1640
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:18,570
我可是神  你这蠢货
I am a god, you dull creature.

1641
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,810
你休想欺辱我  你这...
And I will not be bullied by...

1642
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:31,500
弱爆了的神
Puny god.

1643
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:41,450
权杖
The sceptre...

1644
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:43,840
博士
Doctor.

1645
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:48,670
洛基的权杖  它的能量
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1646
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:50,680
宇宙魔方无人能敌
The Tesseract can't fight,

1647
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,910
但它抵挡不了来自身的攻击
but you can't protect against yourself.

1648
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:53,590
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1649
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:55,150
你不知道自己在做什么
You didn't know what you were doing.

1650
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:59,780
事实上  我知道
Actually, I think I did.

1651
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:03,340
我装了一个可以切断能量源的保险装置
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

1652
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:06,050
洛基的权杖
Loki's sceptre.

1653
02:01:06,410 --> 02:01:08,450
或许能关闭传送门
It may be able to close the portal.

1654
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:12,910
它就在那里
And I'm looking right at it.

1655
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:28,300
先生  我们剩下的能量不足以穿透它的外壳
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

1656
02:01:35,670 --> 02:01:39,060
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《圣经》中的故事  约拿被大鱼吞下肚

1657
02:01:35,670 --> 02:01:39,060
贾维斯  你听过约拿的故事吗
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1658
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:41,630
我不建议你学他
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1659
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,990
弗瑞局长已被解除指挥权
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1660
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:55,230
代行命令  7A11
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1661
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:57,980
7A11命令确认  可以起飞
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

1662
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:00,890
长官  有架战机起飞了
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1663
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:03,260
甲板人员注意  有架战机擅自起飞
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

1664
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:04,570
必须马上阻止
We need to shut it down!

1665
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:07,120
重复  起飞未经许可
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1666
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,180
斯塔克  你听见了吗
Stark, do you hear me?

1667
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:42,190
有一枚导弹朝曼哈顿去了
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

1668
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:43,260
还有多久
How long?

1669
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,740
最多三分钟
Three minutes, max.

1670
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:47,900
它的核弹能将市中心夷为平地
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1671
02:03:48,070 --> 02:03:49,980
贾维斯  将余下动力全部输至推进器
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

1672
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:50,990
输完了
I just did.

1673
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:05,890
核弹已发射
Package is sent.

1674
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:09,380
爆炸倒计时  2分30秒
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1675
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:33,540
准备好再战一轮了吗
Are you ready for another bout?

1676
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:36,550
怎么  你犯困了吗
What, are you getting sleepy?

1677
02:04:41,690 --> 02:04:42,910
对准顶部
Right at the crown!

1678
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:50,690
我能关掉它
I can close it.

1679
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:52,560
你们听见了吗
Can anybody copy?

1680
02:04:53,470 --> 02:04:55,030
我能关掉传送门
I can shut the portal down.

1681
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,930
-快关  -别关  等等
- Do it! - No, wait.

1682
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:58,300
斯塔克  敌人还在不断涌进来
Stark, these things are still coming.

1683
02:04:58,300 --> 02:04:59,100
有枚核弹飞过来了
I got a nuke coming in.

1684
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:00,900
一分钟内就会爆炸
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1685
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:13,160
而我刚好知道该把它送去哪
And I know just where to put it.

1686
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:22,590
斯塔克  你的能量不够回来了
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1687
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:23,960
留着能量转弯吧  老贾
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1688
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:27,140
先生  要我联系波茨小姐吗
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1689
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:29,300
好的
Might as well.

1690
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:34,820
纽约街道沦为战场
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

1691
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:37,510
{\an8}曼哈顿市中心遭袭

1692
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:37,230
军队已到现场对抗敌人
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

1693
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:39,500
但显然力不从心
but clearly, it is outmatched.

1694
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:41,920
我得承认  我干这行这么多年
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

1695
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:43,900
这样的事是闻所未闻
I have never seen anything like this.

1696
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:46,360
我们对这支队伍知之甚少
We have limited information on the team

1697
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:50,310
但我们知道亿万富翁托尼·斯塔克  即钢铁侠
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1698
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:28,290
先生  波茨小姐...
Sir, Miss Potts...

1699
02:06:27,010 --> 02:06:28,140
{\an8}呼叫失败

1700
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:04,890
快点  斯塔克
Come on, Stark.

1701
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,820
关上吧
Close it.

1702
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:34,340
真有你的
Son of a gun.

1703
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,240
他没有减速
He's not slowing down.

1704
02:07:58,540 --> 02:07:59,750
他还有呼吸吗
Is he breathing?

1705
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:29,050
我去
What the hell?

1706
02:08:31,890 --> 02:08:33,130
怎么回事
What just happened?

1707
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:35,550
刚刚没人亲我吧
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1708
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:41,730
我们赢了
We won.

1709
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:46,050
太好了
All right, yay!

1710
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:47,890
万岁  干得好  伙计们
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1711
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:51,660
明天别上班了  给自己放假一天
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

1712
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:54,020
你们吃过土耳其烤肉吗
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1713
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:56,830
离这两条街外有家土耳其烤肉店
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

1714
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:58,790
其实我没吃过  但我想尝尝
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1715
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:00,270
还没结束呢
We're not finished yet.

1716
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:06,840
那就回头再去
And then shawarma after.

1717
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:30,600
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you,

1718
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:36,080
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

1719
02:09:44,190 --> 02:09:45,430
尽管城市饱受摧残
Despite the devastation

1720
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:48,090
在这起已证实为外星入侵的袭击事件中
of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack,

1721
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:51,910
这支名为复仇者联盟小队的英雄壮举
the extraordinary heroics of the group known as the Avengers

1722
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:53,790
对很多人来说不仅是安慰  更值得庆祝
has been to many a cause not only for comfort, but for celebration.

1723
02:09:53,790 --> 02:09:56,320
知道他们的存在真是太好了
It's just really great knowing they're out there.

1724
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:58,860
有人在守护着我们
That someone is watching over us.

1725
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:00,390
我爱你  托尔
I love you, Thor!

1726
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:01,850
这些家伙就...
And then these guys were like...

1727
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:03,500
到处都在爆炸
And then the air goes...

1728
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:05,390
然后那个绿色的家伙就...
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1729
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:06,340
说不清
I don't know.

1730
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:08,840
这些家伙的存在让我觉得不安全
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

1731
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:11,850
我就是有种被蒙在鼓里的感觉
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

1732
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:15,790
纽约有超级英雄  少来了
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

1733
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:17,750
这些所谓的英雄
These so-called "Heroes"

1734
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:19,330
{\an8}谢谢你们  复仇者联盟

1735
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,120
必须为城市的损毁负责
have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city.

1736
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:23,770
他们打完了仗  都跑哪去了
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1737
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:26,830
人们对复仇者联盟充满好奇
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

1738
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:29,420
但他们就像当时突然出现一样地突然消失了
Their sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance...

1739
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,780
怎么  这事反倒怪在他们头上吗
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1740
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:36,910
美国队长是我的救命恩人
Captain America saved my life.

1741
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:43,000
不管他在哪里  不管他们都身处何方
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

1742
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,190
我只想
I would just...

1743
02:10:45,490 --> 02:10:47,300
我只想说声谢谢
I would want to say thank you.

1744
02:10:50,250 --> 02:10:51,840
复仇者们都去哪了
Where are the Avengers?

1745
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:54,240
我暂时没有追查他们的行踪
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1746
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:56,660
在我看来他们有权休假
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1747
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:57,980
宇宙魔方呢
And the Tesseract?

1748
02:10:58,410 --> 02:11:01,000
魔方已经回到了它该去的地方
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1749
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:02,990
远离我们
Out of our reach.

1750
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:05,080
你无权做这种决定
That's not your call.

1751
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:06,430
决定不是我做的
I didn't make it.

1752
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:08,800
做这个决定的是神  我没有争辩
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1753
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,700
你就这么让他带走了魔方
So, you let him take it

1754
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:14,150
还有该为他的罪行受到制裁的战犯洛基
and the war criminal, Loki, who should be answering for his crime.

1755
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,610
我想他会受到制裁的
I think he will be.

1756
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:33,240
我看你没意识到你这么做的后果
I don't think you understand what you've started,

1757
02:11:33,430 --> 02:11:35,440
就这么让复仇者们回到社会上
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

1758
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:37,330
他们都是危险人物
They're dangerous.

1759
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:40,870
确实  他们的威名不仅传遍天下
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

1760
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:43,890
更声振寰宇
Every world knows it.

1761
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:46,260
这不正是我们的目的吗
Was that the point of all this?

1762
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:47,880
一个宣言
A statement?

1763
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:52,050
一个保证
A promise.

1764
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:03,030
长官  之后要怎么办
Sir, how does it work now?

1765
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:05,520
他们都各走各的了
They've gone their separate ways.

1766
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:08,460
有的人还去了很远的地方
Some, pretty extremely far.

1767
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:11,730
再遇到这种情况
If we get into a situation like this again,

1768
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:13,050
我们该怎么办
what happens then?

1769
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:14,720
他们还会回来
They'll come back.

1770
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:17,220
你真的确定吗
Are you really sure about that?

1771
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:18,850
是的
I am.

1772
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,340
为什么
Why?

1773
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:24,550
因为我们需要他们回来
Because we'll need them to.

1774
02:15:16,690 --> 02:15:19,550
人类
Humans.

1775
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:24,650
并不像他说的那样懦弱卑微
They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.

1776
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:27,600
他们坚守家园
They stand.

1777
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:34,030
难以驾驭  不能被统治
They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled.

1778
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:44,400
与他们为敌
To challenge them

1779
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,160
无异于求死
is to court death.
